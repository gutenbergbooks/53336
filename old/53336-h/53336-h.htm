</div><p class='drop-capi0_9'>
It has been a matter of note and, maybe,
of surprise that no attempt has hitherto
been made to gather in one volume the
numerous Words, Phrases, and Turns of
Expression peculiar to <span class='sc'>Our Great Public Schools</span>.
Bare lists of a dozen or more examples may be found
in certain (mostly out-of-date) Records and Histories;
but taking the Schools individually, only in one instance—Winchester—has
there been anything but the most
perfunctory attention given to the subject; and in no
case has the question received that analytical, scientific
treatment—historically and comparatively—which has
proved so invaluable in the “Oxford Dictionary” and
in “Slang and its Analogues.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It would, however, seem almost necessary to emphasise
the fact that this Word-Book is not, <i>per se</i>, a
dictionary of school slang. On the contrary, it is far
more than that. For, though such colloquialisms as are
<i>peculiar</i> to Public School life are naturally and rightly
included, yet by far the larger number of the examples
here set down do not, by any accepted method of classification,
fall within that category. I am led to make
this clear at the outset by reason of a somewhat curious,
but altogether erroneous idea that the present book
was to be a mere reprint of extracts from the larger
work on which, for many years, I have been engaged.
That is not so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor, moreover, do these words and phrases appear,
save in very few instances, in any other work—not even
in so admirably complete a dictionary, in other respects,
as “The Century,” while the monumental Oxford undertaking
will not be available, as a complete authority, for
many years to come.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having thus stated what this work is <i>not</i>, it seems
borne on me to explain, anew, what it <i>is</i>, or rather, what
has been my method. Briefly put, my idea has been
to collect such words, phrases, names, and allusions to
customs as now are, or have been, <i>peculiar</i> to English
Public School life, and to apply to their definition and
elucidation what is known as the “historical” method,
illustrating such examples as lent themselves to it by
quotations from old and present-day writers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Public Schools with which I have been concerned,
arranged chronologically in order of foundation
or charter, are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>How far I have been successful in my task I leave
others to judge. I must confess, however, that the
extent and wealth of this special field of inquiry has
somewhat astonished me: yet I fear my lists are, in
some cases, still incomplete. But, even so, this contribution
towards a more perfect glossary will, I think, be
a revelation to many.</p>

<p class='c005'>No wonder our Mother-tongue is so vigorous, adaptable,
and expansive—reaching out in its creative energy
to all the forms and necessities of modern life—when
even Young England shows such aptitude in coining
new expressions, and adapting older forms to its ever-changing
(and, shall I say, ever-increasing) needs.
Studied comparatively, there will be found much significance,
not alone in the survivals from past generations,
but also in the relatively newer phraseology.
Many an interesting side-light, too, is thrown on ancient
school customs and usages.</p>

<p class='c005'>Though primarily addressing myself to past schoolmen,
it is not without a hope that the general student
and scholar, as well as those still <i>in statu pupillari</i>, will
find something of use and to interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, I desire, though holding myself alone responsible
for aught that is solecismal in these pages,
to acknowledge my indebtedness to those who have
afforded me such unstinted aid in compiling this
work. Especially are my thanks due to Mr. P. K.
Tollit (Derby); Mr. W. Durnford (Eton); Mr. R. D.
Hodgson (Manchester Grammar); Mr. C. A. Ross
(Royal High School, Edin.); Rev. A. E. Hillard (Durham);

Cornish (Christ’s Hospital); Rev. E. W. Badger (King

Eight. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>
<div class='clearme'>

</div>

<p class='c010'><b>Abber</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—1. An abstract: on
history, &amp;c.; set as a punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. An <span class='fss'>ABSIT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>): on whole holidays, or under
medical advice.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Abroad</b>, <i>adv.</i> (Winchester).—Convalescent; out of the
sick-room: <i>e.g.</i> “I have been (or come) <span class='fss'>ABROAD</span>
a week.” <i>Cf.</i> <span class='sc'>Continent</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1534. <span class='sc'>Udall</span>, <i>Roister Doister</i>, ... I bid him keepe warme at
home, For if he come <span class='fss'>ABROADE</span>, he shall cough me a mome.</p>

<p class='c012'>1598. <span class='sc'>Shakspeare</span>, 2 <i>Hen. IV.</i>, i. 2. I am glad to see your Lordship
<span class='fss'>ABROAD</span>. I heard say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your
Lordship goes <span class='fss'>ABROAD</span> by aduice.</p>

<p class='c012'>1761. <i>Letter</i> [<span class='sc'>Wrench</span>]. I have been exceeding ill ... am not
just got <span class='fss'>ABROAD</span> again.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Abs</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Winchester).—Absent: placed against the
name when away from school. [From <i>absunt</i> on
Rolls.]</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb.</i> To take (get, or go) away. Formerly (<i>circa</i>
1840) to <span class='fss'>ABS</span> a tolly (candle) = to put it out; it
now = to take it away whether lighted or unlighted,
the modern <span class='fss'>NOTION</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) for putting it out being
to “dump” it. As a neuter verb <span class='fss'>ABS</span> is generally
used in the imperative: <i>e.g.</i> “<span class='fss'>ABS!</span>” “Oh, do <span class='fss'>ABS</span>!”
Sometimes, however, a fellow is said <span class='fss'>TO ABS</span> quickly,
and <span class='fss'>MESS THINGS</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) are <span class='fss'>ABSED</span>, or put away. To
<span class='fss'>HAVE ONE’S WIND ABSED</span> = to have it taken away
by a violent blow in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Absence</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—Names-calling. [This takes
place at 3 and 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on half-holidays; at 11.30, 3,
and 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on whole-holidays; at 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> only in
summer half.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 174. And the elevens were
made up, as they best might, out of such adventurous spirits as dared
to “skip” roll-calls and <span class='fss'>ABSENCE</span> for the purpose. Eton, when the
losers, attributed the fact to the want of their best men in consequence
of these difficulties.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Absit</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1886. <span class='sc'>Dickens’s</span> <i>Dictionary of the University of Cambridge</i>, p. 3. Every
undergraduate wishing to leave Cambridge for a whole day, not including
a night, must obtain an <span class='fss'>ABSIT</span> from his tutor. Permission to go
away for a longer period, either at the end of the term or in the middle,
is called an “exeat,” and no undergraduate should go down without
obtaining his “exeat.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Academia</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—<i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Academy</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—An exhibition given at
the end of every quarter: the first by <span class='sc'>Rhetoric</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>), the second by <span class='sc'>Poetry</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), the third by
<span class='sc'>Syntax</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), the last, called the <span class='sc'>Great Academies</span>,
by all three combined. This last is the
crowning act of the school year, being attended
by many visitors, and is followed by the annual
distribution of prizes. Hence <span class='sc'>Academy Room</span> = the
large hall in which the chief exhibitions, displays,
concerts, plays, &amp;c., are held. [The name may
have come from the school at Liège, which was
known as the “Academy”; but more probably it is
of much older date, being derived from the “Academiæ”
of the <i>Ratio Studiorum Societatis Jesu</i>.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Accidence</b> (Harrow).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Upper School</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ack</b> (or <b>Ick</b>), <i>intj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—No! nothing.
<i>Ex.</i> “Lend me your book.” “<span class='sc'>Ack!</span>” Obsolete.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Action</b>, <i>subs.</i> (King Edward’s, Birm.: obsolete).—A game
in which a number of boys start from one end of
the cloisters and run to the other, trying to avoid
being captured <i>en route</i> by others who seek to intercept
them. The game was also called <span class='sc'>Fox and
dowdy</span>. These were names in use twenty-five
years ago. To-day the same game is called <span class='sc'>Bacca</span>,
because the prisoners must be held long enough for
the captor to say, “one, two, three, caught, tobacco!”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ad lib.</b>, <i>subs. phr.</i> (Stonyhurst).—The time when boys

<p class='c010'><b>Admonishing-money</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Westminster).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 116. The punishments for
speaking English in hall or school, which have been before alluded to,
were strictly enforced in his [Dr. Busby’s] days in the way of fines,
called <span class='fss'>ADMONISHING-MONEY</span>, which figure occasionally in his [Lynn’s]
account. The custom was for the second boy of the second election
to act as a sort of monitor for this purpose, and to deliver to any boy
who so offended a “mark” or tally, with the words, <i>Tu es custos</i>; this
mark he had to pass in turn to the first whom he could detect in a
similar slip, and the boy with whom the mark remained when hall
broke up incurred a fine. Charles Dryden, son of the poet, thought
himself so hardly used by being made <i>custos</i> three days running (by
some unfairness, as he conceived), that the father wrote a strong letter
on the subject to his old master, Busby, and was very nearly removing
the boy from school.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ad portas</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A Latin
speech delivered by the Senior College Prefect to
the Warden of New College and the <span class='sc'>Posers</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)
under Middle gate at the commencement of Election
week.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 61. When the Warden of
New College, Oxford, with two of his Fellows, called the “posers” (or
at one time “supervisors”), arrive at the college, ... they are received
with a Latin oration <span class='sc'>Ad Portas</span> by the senior scholar. Two
other speeches are delivered in school just before their arrival: 1.
<i>Elizabethæ et Jacobi Laudes</i> (commonly known as “Elizabeth and
Jacob”), by the Prefect of School; 2. <i>Fundatoris Laudes</i>, formerly
assigned to the senior “Founder’s kin” scholar, but now spoken by
the third prefect.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Adsum</b>, <i>intj.</i> (Charterhouse).—The response made in
answer to names-calling.</p>

<p class='c012'>1855. <span class='sc'>Thackeray</span>, <i>The Newcomes</i>, p. 774. At the usual evening
hour the chapel bell began to toll, and Thomas Newcome’s hands outside
the bed feebly beat time. And just as the last bell struck a
peculiar sweet smile shone over his face, and he lifted up his head
a little and quickly said <span class='fss'>ADSUM</span>, and fell back. It was the word
we used at school when names were called; and lo, he whose heart
was as that of a little child had answered to his name, and stood in
the presence of the Master.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 23rd March, 8. 7. As in the old days of
Colonel Newcome, “<span class='fss'>ADSUM</span>,” or “Always ready,” is still the watch-word
of the Charterhouse, whose authorities have issued a neatly-printed
list of Old Carthusians serving in South Africa, in a cover of
the school colours.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, p. 97. <span class='sc'>Adsum</span> is the name of a new institution....
There was no occasion for it when the school was in
London, and none could pass beyond the school precincts. Colonel
Newcome must have answered <span class='fss'>ADSUM</span> at prayers only.</p>

<p class='c012'>1893. <i>Felstedian</i>, June, p. 79. Years ago there existed at Felsted a
class of beings known as “Swimming <span class='fss'>ALDERMEN</span>.” What they were,
and whence they came, I know not; perhaps some Old Felstedian will
be able to enlighten me on the point. Perhaps the name was given to
those who could swim so many times from the “Alders” to “Duck-pond”;
or, perhaps, the name was derived from the aldermanic proportions
of the swimmer. <i>Ibid.</i> (1895, Ap., p. 44). A fourth term,
“<span class='fss'>ALDERMAN</span>,” was not in the list. It has certainly “been dead
lengthy” but was once prized by its possessors, who had to swim so
many times from the “Duck Pond” to “The Alders” before they
could gain the title. Ten lengths of the new bath would afford a fair
test, and <span class='fss'>ALDERMEN</span> might have some privilege or other. Its revival
would be a good thing, for there has of late been a tendency to
prefer diving to swimming.</p>

Prefect of Studies reads out the new forms, prefixing
the formula “<i>Maneant in</i>” or “<i>Ascendant
in</i>” as the case may be. The day is known as
“Ascension Day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1843. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, Nov. 1883, p. 232. The <i>Ascensio Scholarum</i>
was managed quite otherwise then than now [1843-83].... <i>Ascension
Day.</i>—The opening day of schools. Mass of the Holy Ghost is said in
the church, after breakfast. The different schools, headed by their
masters, then return to the schoolrooms which they occupied the
preceding scholastic year. Presently the large bell tolls, and then
the Prefect of Studies opens the door of <span class='sc'>Poetry</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), and announces
that “<span class='sc'>Rhetoric</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) is empty.” The <span class='sc'>Poets</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) leave their room
and ascend to Rhetoric, and forthwith become Rhetoricians, with all
their privileges. Then the (late) Poet’s doorkeeper knocks at <span class='sc'>Syntax’</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>) door and sings out that “Poetry is empty”; and so on through
the different schools. The little fellows newly arrived have to wait
in the gallery until “<span class='sc'>Little Figures</span>” (<i>q.v.</i>) is vacant, when they
become Little Figuricians, “Little Figures,” it will be observed, being

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 349. In this room [Over-School]
it was that, in the latter half of the last century, the punishment
of <span class='fss'>ASH-PLANTING</span> used to take place. It was inflicted by order
and in the presence of a judicial committee of the præposters (Sixth
Form) for some few grave offences against the recognised internal discipline
of the school, <i>e.g.</i> personal assault upon one of their body by a
mutinous fag—an offence which would still be severely punished by
the masters, if not by the Sixth themselves. Three ash-saplings were
used; in theory, at least, the two first were to be broken upon the
person of the culprit. The punishment was severe—perhaps unjustifiably
so; but it had the character of being only inflicted in extreme
cases, and with strict justice, and was not regarded as a cruelty in the
school.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Athens</b> (Eton).—A bathing-place.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, p. 162. No boy is now allowed to go into a boat

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 27. On Shrove-Tuesday verses were written [<i>c.</i> 1561]
in honour or dispraise of Bacchus—“because poets were considered
the clients of Bacchus”—and those composed by the senior boys were
fixed on the inside of the folding-doors of the hall, as was the old
fashion in all schools and colleges. This custom was continued almost
into modern days, and though the subject was changed, the copy of
verses was still called “a <span class='fss'>BACCHUS</span>.” When Pepys paid a visit to the
school in 1665, he found the subject given out for that year was the
one topic of absorbing interest—the Plague.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Back.</b> To <span class='fss'>BACK UP</span>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To call out:

<p class='c010'><b>Bags</b> (or <b>Bags I</b>), <i>intj.</i> (common).—Used to assert a

school slang is <span class='fss'>FAINS</span> or <span class='fss'>FAIN IT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) for demanding
a truce during the progress of a game, and

the passing “bagsmen”—for the commercial travellers to Rugby then
rode with actual saddle-bags; and this practice led to terrible fights
occasionally with the aggrieved riders.</p>

[<span class='sc'>Bakers</span> were of two kinds: that used in “College”
was of large size, oblong in shape, and green in

<p class='c010'><b>Balls</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A Junior in College collects
footballs from the lockers in school and takes them
through at 6 o’clock to the Ball-keeper in Commoners
to be blown or repaired. The Ball-keeper
is an Inferior who, for service in looking after cricket
and foot-balls, is exempted from <span class='fss'>KICKING-IN</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)

<p class='c010'><b>Bally</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Sherborne: obsolete).—Ball court, the old

<p class='c010'><b>Banco</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—Evening preparation at

the Winchester <span class='sc'>Toy-time</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, 81. At old Charterhouse monitors had
unlimited powers.... They were seldom interfered with by any
master; for instance, the visit of a house master to <span class='fss'>BANCO</span> was
intensely resented. There was a “boule” in the Sixth Form of 1872,
as to what a monitor should do who was thus insulted. Should he at
once put his cap on, and take no notice of the master? or would it be
more dignified to walk straight out of the room? <i>Ibid.</i>, 84. The chief
duties of a monitor now are to keep <span class='fss'>BANCO</span>, and to see that order is
preserved in the cubicles, and in his house generally. <span class='sc'>Banco</span> is the
time from 7.30 to 8.55 every week-day evening except Saturday, and
from 8.15 to 8.55 on Sundays, when the Under School sit in Long Room
and prepare their work for the next day. The keeping of <span class='fss'>BANCO</span>
is a fine exercise in discipline for the monitor, and a very convenient
arrangement for the house master. It is a tradition that a monitor
helps every Under School boy with his work during <span class='fss'>BANCO</span> if he can.
<i>Ibid.</i>, 95. The term <span class='fss'>BANCO</span> was suggested by H. W. Phillott, afterwards
Canon of Hereford ... in 1832, or a little later.</p>

points. Northbrooke, in 1577, mentions it as a favourite game in
Devonshire. It is sometimes called <span class='fss'>BANDY-BALL</span>, and an early drawing
of the game is copied in <span class='sc'>Strutt’s</span> <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 102.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bangy</b> (or <b>Bangay</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Brown sugar.
Also as <i>adj.</i> = brown. Hence <span class='fss'>BANGAY BAGS</span> (or
<span class='fss'>BANGIES</span>) = brown-coloured trousers. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span> says
the strong objection to these in former times probably
arose from Tony Lumpkin coming to school
in corduroys. [Suggested derivations are: (1) from
<i>Bangalore</i>, a coarse-sugar growing country; (2)
<i>bhang</i> = hemp; (3) <i>banjy</i> (Essex) = dull, gloomy.]
A brown gate formerly leading from Grass Court
into Sick House Meads was known as the <span class='sc'>Bangy
Gate</span>. The term is now often applied to the gate
by Racquet Court into Kingsgate Street.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bar.</b> <span class='sc'>To bar out</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.:
obsolete).—To lock or barricade the doors to exclude
the masters. This custom has been practically
extinct since the day that Bailie John
Macmorrane was shot by a pupil, William Sinclair,
son of the Chancellor of Caithness, while endeavouring
to get the door battered down (Sept.
15, 1595).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barbar</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Durham).—A candidate for scholarship
from another school. [That is, “barbarian” =
foreigner.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barber</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A thick fagot or bough;
one was included in each bundle. Also any large
piece of wood.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (University).—To work off impositions by
deputy. [Tradition relates that a learned barber
was at one time frequently employed as a scapegoat
in working off this species of punishment inflicted
on peccant students.] Also <span class='fss'>TO BARBERISE</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span> (“Cuthbert Bede”), <i>Verdant Green</i>, xii. As for
impositions, why ... ’Aint there coves to <span class='fss'>BARBERISE</span> ’em for you?</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barge</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Sherborne).—Small cricket: played, with
a stump for bat, against a wall.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (Charterhouse).—To hustle; <span class='fss'>TO MOB UP</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>); <span class='fss'>TO BRICK</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barn, The</b> (Charterhouse).—A temporary wooden
building, constructed in 1876 to meet deficiencies
in class-room accommodation. It stood on the site
now occupied by the Museum. It disappeared in
1884.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barnet</b>, <i>intj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—Nonsense!
Humbug!</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barn-school</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, 367. Dr. James found there
[Rugby in 1777] 52 boys; in five years he had raised them to 165.
The one large schoolroom was no longer sufficient ... a new building
was added.... Even the new schools overflowed, for the
members rose in time to near 300; and the head-master was
obliged to migrate into a barn adjoining the Dunchurch Road....
There for more than twenty years successive head-masters taught
the two senior forms.... Connecting these buildings with the
three schools adjoining the old manor-house was a line of cow-sheds,
which served as a shelter in rainy weather.... Such was
the Rugby of 1809; for it was not till long afterwards that barn
and cow-sheds disappeared, though the present school buildings
were begun in that year.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barracks</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Loretto).—A Form occasionally interpolated
between <span class='sc'>Nippers</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) and Fourth. [In the
Sixties a master at Loretto was known as the Captain,
and when the first overflow from the school-house
took place, the house in which a few boys
slept, and over which he was master, was called
the Garrison. The adjoining house was afterwards
occupied and was called the <span class='fss'>BARRACKS</span>. Whence
the interpolated Form, which for a time had for its
schoolroom a room at that house, getting the name
of the Barracks Form. The name clung to it when
moved to one of the regular schoolrooms.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Barter</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A half volley at cricket.
Also as <i>verb</i>. [From Warden Barter, who was
famous in the cricket-field for dealing with such
balls.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, 65. None showed more enthusiastic
interest in these [Public School Cricket] matches than the late
excellent Warden, Robert Speckott Barter.... He seldom missed
a match at Lord’s from the time he played in the school eleven
himself. He was a tremendous hitter in his day; and the remarkable
punishment which he dealt out to the ball, when he was lucky enough
to catch it on the “half-volley,” has given to a long hit of this
character at Winchester (and even elsewhere) the name of a <span class='fss'>BARTER</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bartlemytide</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general: old).—The summer holiday.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Base</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A goal: at football.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Basinite</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse: obsolete).—A hot-water
fag: he had to get hot water and towels ready
for a monitor when he descended to wash in
<span class='fss'>COCKS</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bat-mugger</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A wooden instrument
used in oiling cricket-bats.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Battal</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow and Charterhouse).—Battalion
drill for the Rifle Corps: usually (at Harrow) in the
evening. [The second is the syllable accentuated.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Battler</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—A student. <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Battlings</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Battlings</b> (or <b>Battels</b>), <i>subs.</i> (general).—An allowance,
in money or kind; apparently originally intended
to supplement the meagre fare of fast-days. <i>Cf.</i>
quots. Hence <span class='fss'>TO BATTEL</span> = to take provisions from
the buttery.</p>

<p class='c012'>1786-1805. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span>, <i>Purley</i>, 390, <i>s.v.</i> <span class='sc'>Battel</span>, a term used at Eton
for the small portion of food which, in addition to the College allowance,
the Collegers receive from the Dames.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 184. The
expense was defrayed by the boys subscribing the last three <span class='fss'>BATTLINGS</span>
(<i>i.e.</i> the weekly shilling allowed each boy). This was rather an
illusory coin, for we seldom actually fingered it, as some one of the
College servants generally had a kind of prescriptive right to a benefit;
and whenever Saturday arrived, Præfect of Hall’s valet was sure to
come round to ask the boys if they would give their <span class='fss'>BATTLING</span> to Rat
Williams, or Dungy, or Pulver, or Long John, or some other equally
deserving individual.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span>, <i>Verdant Green</i>, <span class='fss'>II.</span> vii. [Note]. <span class='sc'>Battels</span> are
the accounts of the expenses of each student. It is stated in Todd’s
<i>Johnson</i> that this singular word is derived from the Saxon verb,
meaning “to count or reckon.” But it is stated in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> for 1792, that the word may probably be derived from the
Low-German word <i>bettahlen</i>, “to pay,” whence may come our English
word <i>tale</i> or <i>score</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1864. <i>Household Words</i>, p. 188. The business of the latter was to
call us of a morning to distribute amongst us our <span class='fss'>BATTLINGS</span>, or
pocket-money.</p>

<p class='c012'>1880. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>Autobiogr.</i>, i. 13. Every boy had a shilling a week
pocket-money, which we called <span class='fss'>BATTELS</span>. [This is probably a misprint—the
Winchester term, as that used at other schools, is <span class='fss'>BATTLING</span>.
It was advanced out of the pocket of the Second Master.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1886-87. <span class='sc'>Dickens</span>, <i>Dictionary of Oxford and Cambridge</i>, p. 16. <span class='sc'>Battels</span>
is properly a designation of the food obtained from the College
Buttery. An account of this, and of the account due to the Kitchen,
is sent in to every undergraduate weekly, hence these bills also are
known as <span class='fss'>BATTELS</span>, and the name, further, is extended to the total
amount of the term’s expenses furnished by the College. In some
Colleges it is made essential to the keeping of an undergraduates’
term that he should <span class='fss'>BATTEL</span>, <i>i.e.</i> obtain food in College on a certain
number of days each week.</p>

<p class='c012'>1889. <span class='sc'>Murray</span>, <i>Hist. Eng. Dict.</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Battels</span>. Much depends on
the original sense at Oxford: if this was ‘food, provisions,’ it is
natural to connect it with “<span class='fss'>BATTLE</span>,” to feed, or receive nourishment....
It appears that the word has apparently undergone progressive extensions
of application, owing partly to changes in the internal economy
of the colleges. Some Oxford men of a previous generation state that
it was understood by them to apply to the buttery accounts alone, or
even to the provisions ordered from the buttery, as distinct from the
“commons” supplied from the kitchen; but this latter use is disavowed
by others, ... but whether the <span class='fss'>BATTELS</span> were originally the
provisions themselves, or the sums due on account of them, must at
present be left undecided.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Baulk</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A false report. This is
<span class='fss'>SPORTED</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), not spread.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beak</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A master. <span class='sc'>Form-beak</span> = Form-master.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beanfielder</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Felsted: obsolete).—A long hit: at
cricket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bearded Cad</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A porter employed
by the College to convey luggage from the railway
station to the school. [The term originated in an
extremely hirsute individual, who, at one time,
acted in the capacity.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beards!</b> <i>intj.</i> (The Leys: obsolete).—An ejaculation
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beast</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—A student who, having left
school, goes up to Cambridge to study before entering
the university. [Because (so it is stated) he
is neither man nor boy.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bedmaker</b> (or <b>Bedder</b>) <i>subs.</i> 1. (Cambridge).—A charwoman;
a servant who makes beds and does other
necessary domestic duties for residents in College.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i>, 6. Remember me most kindly
to Mrs. Bloggins. I shall never forget how good she was when we
were at Cambridge last term.... These <span class='fss'>BEDMAKERS</span> are kind souls
after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Oxford).—<span class='sc'>Bedder</span> = a bedroom.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beef Row</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Shrewsbury).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, 247. The dinners themselves
[<i>c.</i> 1800-40] were fairly good, with the exception of the “boiled beef”
days, which were highly unpopular. The beef was probably good
enough, but it was cured with saltpetre, and the consequent redness
was, in the boys’ eyes, objectionable. Remonstrances had been made
in vain; and the result was something like a school rebellion, well
remembered as the <span class='fss'>BEEF ROW</span>. By concerted arrangement, on one
day the boys in every hall rose from the table in a body, and left the
masters and the boiled beef in sole occupation. Butler was indignant;
he came into each of the halls after locking up, and demanded from
the heads of the school a public apology for the insult, giving them an
hour for consideration, and placing before them the alternative of
immediate dismissal. The boys held together, and, early the next
morning the whole of the Sixth Form, comprising no less than three
who were to be future heads of Colleges, were started by chaise or
coach for their respective homes. The rest of the boys declared
themselves <i>en revolte</i>; they would not go into school, and the masters
walked about the court alternately threatening and persuading. At
last a gentleman in the town, an old Shrewsbury boy, much respected,
harangued the rebels, and persuaded them to surrender. Some sort
of concession seems almost to have been made by a portion of the
absent Sixth Form under home influence, and the affair ended in the
return of all the exiles.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Beeswaxers</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Thick boots for football.
[Pronounced Bĕswaxers.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Behind</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton and Winchester).—A back at football.
At Eton <span class='fss'>SHORT BEHIND</span> and <span class='fss'>LONG BEHIND</span>:
usually abbreviated to “short” and “long.” At
Winchester, <span class='fss'>SECOND BEHIND</span> and <span class='fss'>LAST BEHIND</span>.
These answer to the half-back and back of Association
football. At Winchester, in the Fifteens, there
is also a <span class='fss'>THIRD BEHIND</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Up behind</span>, <i>phr.</i> (The Leys).—Out of bounds:

<p class='c010'><b>Behind one’s Side.</b> <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Side</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bejant</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Aberdeen).—A new student: one of the

and <span class='sc'>Magistrands</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Belial</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Oxford).—Balliol College.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bells.</b> <span class='sc'>Bells go single</span>, <i>phr.</i> (Winchester).—A single
bell is rung for five minutes before the hour at
which chapel commences. For College evening
chapel three three’s are rung, and then follows a
“bell,” one for every man in College—70. <span class='sc'>Bells
down</span> = <i>see</i> quots.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 62. The
junior in chamber had a hard time of it; ... while endeavouring to
get through his multifarious duties, he had to keep a sharp ear on the
performance of the chapel bell, and to call out accordingly, “first
peal!” “second peal!” and <span class='fss'>BELLS DOWN!</span></p>

<p class='c012'>1878. <span class='sc'>Adams</span>, <i>Wykehamica</i>, p. 256. At a quarter to six the peal
again rang out, and the cry of <span class='fss'>BELLS GO</span> was sounded in shrill tones
through every chamber of College and Commoners.... After ten
minutes the peal changed, and only a single bell continued to ring.
This was notified by the cry <span class='fss'>BELLS GO SINGLE</span>, and five minutes afterwards,
by that of “<span class='fss'>BELLS DOWN</span>.”... Presently the head-master ...
would descend from his library: or the second master ... would appear
at the archway near Sixth Chamber, and the warning voice would
be heard “Gabell,” or “Williams through,” “Williams,” or “Ridding
in.” Straightway there would be a general rush, the college-boys
darting across the quadrangle in the rear of the Præfect of Chapel;
while the Commoners hurried in, keeping up a continuous stream from
their more distant quarters.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Belly-hedge</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Shrewsbury).—An obstruction of
such a height that it can easily be cleared: of
school steeplechases. [That is, about belly high.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Belows</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Cap</span> (3).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bender</b>, <i>subs.</i> (common).—The bow-shaped segment of
a kite.</p>

<p class='c012'>1873. Dr. <span class='sc'>Blackley</span>, <i>Hay Fever</i>, p. 145. The first kite was six
feet in length by three feet in width, and was made of the usual form,
namely, with a central shaft or “standard,” and a semicircular top or
<span class='fss'>BENDER</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bene-book</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, 131. Besides prizes, <span class='fss'>BENE-BOOKS</span> are
awarded to the Sixth Forms on the following system: Every boy
generally does four classical exercises a week, viz., Greek and Latin
prose, Greek and Latin verse, and one mathematical exercise; these
are marked, according to their merit, <span class='fss'>B</span>, b, sb, s, vs, m, <span class='fss'>M</span>; that is to
say, Big bene, bene, satis bene, satis, vix satis, male, Big male....
A <span class='fss'>BENE-BOOK</span> (value 12s. 6d.) is earned by the winner of two <span class='fss'>BENES</span> a
week throughout the quarter. There used to be a yet higher mark,
<i>i.e.</i>, B†, or a <span class='sc'>Write-out</span>, which counted four. A B† denoted that the
composition to which it was attached was worthy of being written
out in a book kept with a view to forming a new edition of “Sertum
Carthusianum.” There are many volumes of old <span class='sc'>Write-out</span> books on
the shelves of the library, but for years no addition has been made to
them. The <span class='sc'>Write-out</span> is quite obsolete.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bevers</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—An afternoon meal or refreshment;
a snack between meals. Whence (Winchester)
<span class='fss'>BEVERS</span> (or <span class='fss'>BEVER-TIME</span>) = an interval
from 4.30 to 5 in afternoon school, observed (says

to the afternoon snack of harvest-men and other labourers, and
perhaps may be explained more correctly as any refreshment taken
between the regular meals. Sometimes refreshments of drink, or
drinkings, were called <span class='fss'>BEVERS</span>; but potations were not <span class='fss'>BEVERS</span>, as
Mr. Dyce asserts.</p>

assisted at floggings. He now reads lessons in
Chapel, and takes round <span class='fss'>ROLLS</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). He is absolved

of the Præfects, who held these offices in rotation—the former lasting
for a week, the latter for one day only. They paraded School armed
with sticks, and brought up to the Head and Second Masters (who
alone had the power of flogging) the names of the delinquents which
had been “ordered” for punishment; the names of the more heinous
offenders being confided to the <span class='fss'>BIBLE-CLERK</span>, the others to the

for a candle-sconce, known as the “nail,” under which any boy who

very stringent regulations. [Now called Sixth Form game.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Big-school</b>, <i>subs.</i> (King Edward’s, Birm.).—The room

<p class='c010'><b>Big-side</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby and elsewhere).—The combination
of all the bigger fellows in the school in one and
the same game or run. Also the ground specially
used for the game so denominated. Hence <span class='sc'>Big-side</span>
run = a paper-chase, in which picked representatives
of all Houses take part, as opposed to a

<p class='c012'>c. 1850. <span class='sc'>Brodrick</span>, <i>Memories and Impressions</i>. ... It is credibly
reported of Mr. Cookesley—who, in spite of a tendency to buffoonery,
was an inspiring teacher—that he addressed a remarkably stupid boy
in the following terms: “I tell you what it is, sir, if you ever show me
up a copy of your own verses again, I’ll put you in the <span class='fss'>BILL</span>” (an
Etonian euphemism for a capital punishment). “Why, a great strong

own concoction I’ll have you flogged.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 100. Bagshawe even went so
far as to rebuke one of the monitors for rising in Mr. James’ presence;
and when told that it was by Mr. Busby’s order, desired him to write
that down on his <span class='fss'>BILL</span>; a proceeding equivalent, as Mr. Busby declared,
and as Westminster and Eton men will perhaps agree, to ordering the
head-master up for corporal punishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>1876. <span class='sc'>Brinsley Richards</span>, <i>Seven Years at Eton</i>. Some of the
small boys whom this delightful youth tempted to ape his habits, had

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—The “call-over” of the whole

boys of rank, and during Thackeray’s time had been exempted from
appearing at <span class='fss'>BILLS</span>. Sumner stopped this privilege, to the great disgust
of Dr. Glasse and some of his aristocratic friends. Earl Radnor
even threatened to “ruin the school” if Sumner refused to give way;
but the new head-master was firm. Lord Dartmoor, on the other
hand, supported him, and removed his sons into his House from
Glasse’s, who was beaten in the struggle, and left Harrow. <i>Ibid.</i>, 293.
At the time of his appointment he was only twenty-six, but his reputation
as a scholar stood very high. It is enough to say that under
his rule Harrow has increased in numbers, and certainly not lost in
reputation. The last <span class='fss'>BILL-BOOK</span> contains 492 names.</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <i>Public School Mag.</i>, Dec., p. 446. The uniformity of daily life

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 89. The
Kitchen is a spacious apartment with a vaulted roof, occupying the entire
height of the building on the west side of the quadrangle, and at least
half its length; here we might see a few Fags endeavouring to coax
Jem Sims, John Coward, or Mother Mariner (the cooks) for an extra
supply of mashed potatoes, till Kitchen is cleared by the exasperated
Manciple, who has just detected a delinquent in the act of secreting
under his gown an armful of the small faggots used for lighting the
Kitchen fires (called <span class='fss'>BILL BRIGHTERS</span>), an opportunity for purloining
which was never allowed to slip by a Junior of a properly regulated

bearing the name of “John Dryden,” no doubt cut by the poet

<p class='c010'><b>Bird</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Durham).—A credulous boy; one easily

<p class='c010'><b>Black-jack</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A large leathern beer

<p class='c010'><b>Blazer</b>, <i>subs.</i> (originally Cambridge: now general).—A

<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—In your article of to-day, under the above heading, you speak
of “a striped red and black <span class='fss'>BLAZER</span>,” “the <span class='fss'>BLAZER</span>,” also of “the

becoming the generic. A <span class='fss'>BLAZER</span> is the red flannel boating jacket
worn by the Lady Margaret, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Boat Club.
When I was at Cambridge it meant that and nothing else. It seems
from your article that a <span class='fss'>BLAZER</span> now means a coloured flannel jacket,
whether for cricket, tennis, boating, or seaside wear.—Yours faithfully,

at anything.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bleyis-sylver</b> (or <b>Bent-sylver</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Royal High
School, Edin.).—A gratuity given in olden times
by pupils to masters. He who gave most was proclaimed
“<i>victor</i>” or “king.” [<span class='sc'>Bleyis</span> is derived from
<i>bleis</i> = a torch or blaze (mod. Scot. <i>bleeze</i>). <span class='sc'>Bleyis-sylver</span>
= silver given at Candlemas on the time of
the bleeze. Dr. Jamieson (<i>Dict.</i>) suggests <i>bent</i> =
Fr. <i>benit</i>, <i>i.e.</i> blessed, because money was given on
a Saint’s day. Dr. <span class='sc'>Stevens</span>, the school historian,
suggests <i>bent</i> = coarse grass. In sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries pupils had leave to go and
cut this coarse grass to strew on floor of school.
Afterwards annual holidays were instituted on first
Mondays of May, June, and July, when a money
payment was made to the master to purchase
“bent.” (<i>Cf.</i> <span class='sc'>Stevens’</span> <i>Hist. of High School</i>, p. 678.)
This is more probable.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Block, The</b> (Eton).—A wooden step in the library of

<p class='c010'><b>Blockhouse</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A sick-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 320. Harrow fagging had no
special reputation for cruelty; yet there are those living who can
remember having been called out of their beds at night to have cold
water poured down their backs—for no special reason, but as a part
of the hardening process considered good for fags generally; or to
start from Leith’s boarding-house in the dark, to go round the church-yard
by the north porch—<span class='fss'>BLOODY PORCH</span>, as it was called, from some
obscure legend. Once a boy was sent upon this dreaded tour at night,
when it so happened that there were a party concealed in the porch,
watching the grave of a newly-buried relative—for these were the
days of resurrection-men; they mistook the unfortunate fag for a
body-snatcher, and fired at him, wounding him slightly, and frightening
him almost to death.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Blotch</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Blotting-paper.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Blow</b>, <i>subs.</i> (old University).—A drunken frolic; a spree.

“Thou blynkerd blowboll, thou wakyst too late.”]</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='fss'>MANSFIELD</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 30. The

<p class='c012'>1864. <i>Blackwood</i>, p. 86. The remaining eight college præfects

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 55. The remaining eight
college prefects (called in Winchester tongue <span class='fss'>BLUCHERS</span>) have a more
limited authority, confined to chambers and the quadrangle; the form
of making these is—“<i>Præficio te sociis concameralibus</i>.” At least two
prefects are located in each of the seven chambers—one from the first
seven in rank, and one from the next seven. The juniors are also
divided into ranks of seven, and out of each rank the prefects, according
to their seniority, chose one each to fill up the numbers in their
own chamber; so that each chamber has, to a certain extent, ties and
associations of its own.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Blue</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—A scholar of Christ’s

with ample skirts to it, a yellow vest underneath in
winter time, small-clothes of Russia duck, worsted
yellow stockings, a leathern girdle, and a little
black worsted cap, usually carried in the hand,
being the complete costume. This was the ordinary

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, p. 170. The time-honoured custom of <span class='fss'>SITTING A
BOAT</span> must here claim mention. Some old Etonian, of generous and
festive disposition (generally an old “oar”), signifies to the captain of
a boat his intention of presenting the crew with a certain quantity of
champagne. In return he is entitled to be rowed up to Surly in the
boat to which he presents the wine; he occupies the coxswain’s seat,
who kneels or stands behind him. This giver of good things is called,
from this circumstance, a “sitter”; and the question, “Who <span class='fss'>SITS
YOUR BOAT</span>?” or, “Have you a sitter?” is one of some interest, which
may often be heard addressed to a captain. The seat of honour in the
ten-oar is usually offered to some distinguished old Etonian. Mr.
Canning occupied it in 1824.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bodleian, The</b> (Oxford).—A famous library, popularly
known as the Bodley, founded by Humphrey, Duke
of Gloucester, 1445-80. Despoiled in 1550 and
again in 1556, it was restored and added to in
1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley. It now contains some
600,000 volumes, and is especially rich in manuscripts
(some 30,000 volumes) and other literary
treasures. James Russell Lowell, the distinguished
American, says of this famous library: “Directly we
enter, we are struck by the stillness and solemnity
that reign around, helped by the dim light, the
windows with painted glass, the ponderous shelves,
the illuminated missals, the graduates or attendants
conversing in low whispers or moving quietly about.
For reading purposes the library is as free and as
good as the library of the British Museum; with
the advantages that you may be seated in front of
a window commanding a beautiful garden prospect,
that your arm-chair is not disturbed, that books
are allowed to accumulate around you, and that
you are not obliged to return them to the care
of the custodian on leaving the library. The
visitor will not fail to notice the portraits in the
upper library, and especially to cast a grateful look
at the fine portrait of Bodley. He will see the
exercise-books used by Edward VI. and Elizabeth
when children, and, close by, the autographs of
distinguished visitors.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Boiler</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A plain coffee-pot used for

to <span class='fss'>BOOK</span> the performer (<i>i.e.</i> hurl a shower of books at him) if he fails
more than once. This right was liberally exercised in 1865, when the
wrath of the school had culminated owing to repeated failures in that

with his only available missile—the frying-pan—and a serious row was
the consequence.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Books</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—1. The prizes formerly presented
by Lord Say and Sele, now given by the

the whole of the rest of the School (but <i>see</i>

Middle Part, Junior Part, each part being divided
into so many divisions, Senior, Middle, and Junior,
or Senior, 2nd, 3rd, and Junior, as the case may
require. Formerly there was also “<span class='sc'>Fourth Book</span>,”
but it ceased to exist about the middle of the
Sixties.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 104. The
school was divided into three classes, or <span class='fss'>BOOKS</span>, as they were called.
Of these, the Præfects formed one, <span class='sc'>Sixth Book</span>; <span class='sc'>Fifth Book</span> was
subdivided into three parts, called respectively “Senior, Middle, and
Junior part of the Fifth”; in speaking of them, the words “of the
Fifth” were generally omitted. The rest of the boys made up
“Fourth Book.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 24. The tiers of stone seats,
which may still be noticed in the deep recesses of the windows, were
the places in which the prefects sat when the boys were arranged in
their respective <span class='fss'>BOOKS</span>; the term still used at Winchester for what in
other schools would be called “forms” or “classes.” There were then,
as now, four <span class='fss'>BOOKS</span> only, though the highest was and is numbered as
the “sixth.” Then followed the fifth, fourth, and second fourth. The
work of the sixth <span class='fss'>BOOK</span> comprised Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, Cicero,
Martial, and “Robinson’s Rhetoric.” <i>Ibid.</i>, 36. Ninety feet long and
thirty-six in breadth, it is sufficiently spacious to allow all the <span class='fss'>BOOKS</span>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Books</span>. It has been
suggested that this phrase arose from the school having originally to
go up to the Donatus—the one book which College boasted; and an
entry is extant of a three days’ remedy being entailed by the book
going to be bound. The pluralization would be no more than an
ordinary Wykehamical inflection.... The following mysterious use
of <i>Libri</i>, however, suggests a much more probable origin. <span class='sc'>Chris.
Johnson</span> says: “<i>Seu Chandlerus erat, seu Custos ordine primus, Durus
ab inductis dicitur esse LIBRIS!</i>” To which a contemporaneous note
is appended: “<i>Lectionum a cæna repetitiones instituisse creditur, quas
Wiccamici materna lingua Libros dicunt.</i>” What these “repetitiones”
were is not clear; but they were some form of lesson which præ-Elizabethan
Wykehamists had christened <span class='fss'>BOOKS</span> in their <i>materna lingua</i>,
and Johnson’s annotator thought the word strange enough to deserve
a note. We may, therefore, very possibly be only perpetuating this
word in our use of <span class='fss'>UP TO BOOKS</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>Athenæum</i>, 17th Feb., 208. <span class='sc'>Botany-bay</span> is often found as
strangely misapplied as the “Paradise” of so many rows. For instance,
the “Quad” of Trinity College, Dublin, which has been so
called for generations, can hardly have ever been remarkable for its
flora. The probable explanation is that its buildings were old and
uncomfortable, and it was the favourite abode of the youngest and
noisiest members of the University.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Second bounce</span>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A

<p class='c012'>1887. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, July, p. 18, “Stonyhurst in the Fifties.”
<span class='sc'>Second bounce</span>, a variety of handball played with small balls most
artistically made of strips of indiarubber, and covered with the best
kid-leather. These balls had to be taken to pieces and remade after
every match, and they had to be quite freshly made when used. Their
seams required to be frequently rubbed over with wax, some of which
was always smeared on the handball wall for the purpose. For a game
of <span class='fss'>SECOND BOUNCE</span> a whole side of one of the big handballs was
required, and it was played by eight players, four a side. The “over-all”
of ordinary handball was the “over line,” and the bulk of the
players stood out yards beyond it. He whose “hand” it was bounced
the ball, and with a long strong swing of his arm hit it up against the
wall, whence with a sharp smack it rebounded high in the air and far
out into the ground. As it descended one of the opposite party stopped
it with his hand and let it <span class='fss'>BOUNCE</span> twice on the ground, the <span class='fss'>FIRST
BOUNCE</span> being, as a rule, too high to let him strike it, and then with a
similar swing hit it up again. The rules, except as to permitting the
ball to be taken up at the <span class='fss'>SECOND BOUNCE</span>, were similar to those of
handball. Balls perished quickly in such a game, nearly a dozen being
required for one. <span class='sc'>Second bounce</span> used chiefly to be played on Sunday
afternoon, after Vespers, and almost all not engaged in the game would
range themselves on the flanks to watch.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bounder</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—A dog-cart.</p>

Such a boy is said to be “put <span class='fss'>ON BOUNDS</span>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1512. <i>Charter of Henry VIII.</i> The King’s Hall and College of
<span class='sc'>Brasenose</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1800. <span class='sc'>Churton</span>, <i>Life of Bishop Smith</i>, 227. Brazen Nose Hall, as the
Oxford antiquary has shown, may be traced as far back as the time of
Henry III., about the middle of the thirteenth century; and early in
the succeeding reign, 6 Edward I., 1278, it was known by the name
of Brasen Nose Hall, which peculiar name was undoubtedly owing, as
the same author observes, to the circumstance of a nose of brass affixed
to the gate. It is presumed, however, that this conspicuous appendage
of the portal was not formed of the mixed metal which the word
now denotes, but the genuine produce of the mine; as is the nose, or
rather face, of a lion or leopard still remaining at Stamford, which also
gave name to the edifice it adorned. And hence, when Henry VIII.
debased the coin by an alloy of <i>copper</i>, it was a common remark or
proverb, that “Testons were gone to Oxford, to study in <i>Brasen</i>
Nose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1837. <span class='sc'>Ingram</span>, <i>Memorials of Oxford</i>. <span class='sc'>Brasenose</span>.... This curious
appellation, which, whatever was the origin of it, has been perpetuated
by the symbol of a brazen nose here and at Stamford, occurs with the
modern orthography, but in one undivided word, so early as 1278, in
an inquisition now printed in <i>The Hundred Rolls</i>, though quoted by
Wood from the manuscript record.</p>

<p class='c012'>1837. <i>British Critic</i>, xxiv. 139. There is a spot in the centre of the city
where Alfred is said to have lived. <span class='sc'>Brasenose</span> claims his palace, Oriel
his church, and University his school or academy. Of these <span class='sc'>Brasenose</span>
is still called “the King’s Hall,” which is the name by which Alfred
himself, in his laws, calls his palace; and it has its present singular
name from a corruption of <i>brasinium</i>, or <i>brasin-huse</i>, as having been
originally located in that part of the royal mansion which was devoted
to the then important accommodation of a brew-house.</p>

<p class='c012'>1898. <span class='sc'>Alden</span>, <i>Oxford Guide</i>, 52. Brasenose Hall (thirteenth century)
is said to have derived the name from its occupying the site of a <i>brasen-hus</i>
or brewhouse. Over the old entrance-gate is the representation of
a <i>brazen nose</i>, probably added at a much later date, when punning
rebuses of this kind were in fashion.</p>

<p class='c012'>1798. Narrative “Christ’s Hospital, Three quarters of a Century

about seven, when we all went into the hall, the nurses following, with
boys from each ward (called <span class='fss'>BREAD-BOYS</span>) carrying large baskets on
their shoulders containing bread, which were taken to the head of
each table, where stood the nurse, who, after “grace,” went down
the table, serving out to each boy half of a twopenny loaf of bread.
“Well,” you’ll say, “but where’s the butter?” None was allowed—nothing
but bare bread. Those who had been sparing over night to
save a portion of the small piece of cheese they had for their supper,
pulled it out of their pockets. Sometimes a great fellow would make
a little boy always supply him with cheese of mornings, out of the
piece the poor fellow had had for his supper the night previous. Beer
we had certainly, served out in wooden vessels of an extraordinary
shape, called “piggins”; about six of them for four boys to drink out
of, but such beer! The piggins were seldom replenished, for we
could not drink it. We used to call it “the washings of the brewers’
aprons.”</p>

had to be careful of their politics. Thus Master Robert
Brooke, the fourth of the “schoolmasters,” is said to have refused to
sign the Solemn League and Covenant, and to have flogged some of
his boys for Parliamentary proclivities. He was ejected from his office
in 1643. At the Restoration, though not fully restored, he was given
“two chambers in cloisters and a pension of £30 a year.” After his
death these two chambers were knocked into one and it became
<span class='sc'>Brooke hall</span>.</p>

in each division start at a distance apart of 175 feet
from stern to stern in the order at which they left
off at the last preceding race, and any boat which
overtakes and <span class='fss'>BUMPS</span> another (<i>i.e.</i> touches it in any
part) before the winning post is reached, changes
places with it for the next race. Hence <span class='fss'>BUMP-SUPPER</span>

another College immediately in its front, thereby gaining a place
towards the head of the river,—a <span class='fss'>BUMP-SUPPER</span> was a famous opportunity
for discovering both the rowing and paying capabilities of
Freshmen, who, in the enthusiasm of the moment, would put down

a “valet” in chambers, one or two “breakfast fags,” and the power
of fagging the twenty juniors when in school or in meads. The junior

<p class='c010'><b>Cannibal</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—In a <span class='fss'>BUMPING-RACE</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)
a College may be represented by more than one
boat. The best talent is put into the first, but it
has sometimes happened that the crew of the
second have got so well together that it has disappointed
the prophets and bumped the first of its
own College. In this case it is termed <span class='fss'>A CANNIBAL</span>,
it having eaten up its own kind, and a fine is exacted
from it by the University Boat Club.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Canoodle</b>, <i>verb</i> (Oxford).—To paddle or propel a canoe.</p>

<p class='c012'>1879. <span class='fss'>E. H. MARSHALL</span>, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5 S., xi. 375. When
I was an undergraduate at Oxford, to <span class='fss'>CANOODLE</span> was the slang expression
for paddling one’s own canoe on the bosom of the Cherwell or

<p class='c010'><b>Cantab</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—A student at Cambridge
University. [An abbreviation of “<span class='sc'>Cantabrigian</span>.”]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Canvas</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 66. The Winchester football
game is peculiar. It is played in <span class='fss'>CANVAS</span>, as it is called. A portion of
Meads, some 80 feet by 25, is marked off by screens of canvas on each
side, within which the game is played, the two open ends forming the
lines of goal, across which the ball is to be kicked. It is placed in the
middle of the ground to begin with, and a “hot” formed round it by
the players stooping down all close together, with their heads down,
and at a given signal trying to force the ball or each other away.
The canvas screens answer to the Rugby “line of touch”; when the
ball escapes over these it is returned into play by juniors stationed for
the purpose, and a hot is formed afresh.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To go on the canvas</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Manchester
Grammar).—To finish drill (dumb-bells, clubs, &amp;c.),
and do gymnastic exercises on the ladder, bars,
rings, and ropes. [The floor beneath the latter was
once covered with stuffed canvas; the phrase is
retained, though the canvas has given way to
mats.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cap</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Westminster).—The collection at Play and
Election dinners. [The College cap was passed
round on the last night of Play for contributions.
<i>Cf.</i> “to send round the cap.”]</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 157. Queen Elizabeth seems
to have been present on at least one occasion, and to have contributed
liberally to the <span class='fss'>CAP</span>, for she is recorded to have paid, in January 1564,
the sum of £8, 6s. 8d. for certain plays by the grammar school at Westminster
and the children at Powle’s. A shout of “<span class='fss'>CAP, CAP!</span>” arises,
and all available trenchers having been pressed into the service, the
captain distributes them amongst the Old Westminster portion of the
audience, who present substantial proofs of their satisfaction. The
sum collected in the <span class='fss'>CAP</span> has frequently amounted to above £200.
After discharging all expenses of the play the surplus is divided among
the performers. But as these expenses have a natural tendency to
increase rather than diminish, while the number of old Westminsters
present is necessarily fewer than in the more prosperous days of the
school, the balance has of late been now and then on the wrong side.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—A cap of House Colours, given by
Captains of House Cricket elevens to the House
eleven, or to some of them. The gift confers permanent
membership. Hence, the recipient of such
a distinction. <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Fez</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 94. Second Eleven matches are played
between the various Houses, and a challenge cup is presented at
the end of the term to the best house. No <span class='fss'>CAP</span> may play in these
matches.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. (Rugby).—Each House had [1871] two <span class='fss'>CAPS</span>,
one the football cap and the other the house-cap.
The former was a sign of distinction, and
worn only by the few boys in the school to whom
it had been given.... If a boy distinguished himself
in cricket, he was allowed to wear a red band;
or, as a higher distinction, a blue band.... Distinctions
might be varied in all manner of ways
according as a boy had won his red or his blue band,
his flannels, or his cap.... <span class='sc'>Caps</span> are now (1890)
given by the head of the School Fifteen. After the
<span class='sc'>Caps</span> come the <span class='sc'>Flannels</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), and then come
the players without distinction. The <span class='sc'>Caps</span> and
<span class='sc'>Flannels</span> in each House go to make up the House
Fifteen; the <span class='sc'>Flannels</span>, without the <span class='sc'>Caps</span>, go to
make up the second fifteen in each House, which
is called <span class='sc'>Below Caps</span>, or for brevity, <span class='sc'>Below</span>. The
next fifteen in each House are called <span class='sc'>Two Belows</span>,
and so on, though it rarely happens that a House
has more <span class='sc'>Belows</span> than two.—<span class='sc'>Lees Knowles.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (general).—To take off or touch one’s hat
in salutation: also <span class='fss'>TO CAP TO</span> and <span class='fss'>TO CAP IT</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Captain of Election</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Westminster).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 183. The <span class='fss'>CAPTAIN OF ELECTION</span>—the
boy who gains first place—has the privilege of being almost
entirely exempted from the fagging incidental to his junior year, and
has his name painted on the election board in gold letters. These
tablets, fixed up in the dormitory, go back as far as 1629; and among the
names of the <span class='fss'>CAPTAINS</span>, besides Lord Mansfield, as already mentioned,
may be read those of Markman, Warren Hastings, Cyril Jackson and
his brother the bishop, Randolph (Bishop), Abbot (Speaker), Longley,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Captain of the Boats</b>, <i>subs. phr.</i> (Eton).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, p. 164. The <span class='fss'>CAPTAIN OF THE BOATS</span> is perhaps
the greatest person in the school next to the head-master—if, indeed,
he does not rival that great authority in the estimation of the boys.
The whole regulation of the boats, both as to the selection of the crew
of the racing “eight,” and of the <span class='fss'>CAPTAINS</span> of the several boats which
form the Fourth of June procession, rests entirely with him; and as he
has a great deal of this kind of patronage at his disposal, his influence
is very considerable. The boat crews are in some sort looked upon as
the aristocracy of the school, and for this reason the position is an
object of social ambition amongst the boys.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cargo</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A hamper from home. The
word is still in use.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 77. The
boys, eager for breakfast, tumultuously rushed out from school-court
... to see if Poole, the porter, had letters, or, what was even more
delightful, a <span class='fss'>CARGO</span> (a hamper of game or eatables from home).</p>

supplement their fare with jam, potted meats, ... or, better still,
from the contents of <span class='fss'>CARGOES</span>, <i>i.e.</i> hampers from home.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cart</b>, <i>verb</i> (University).—To defeat: in a match, a fight,
an examination, a race, &amp;c. “We <span class='fss'>CARTED</span> them

<p class='c010'><b>Case</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Westminster).—The discussion by Seniors

worn when going to Cathedral.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cat-and-cartridge</b>, <i>subs.</i> (The Leys).—Rabbit (or
chicken) with sausage.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cat’s</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—St. Catharine’s Hall. Hence
<span class='fss'>CAT’S-MEN</span> = members of St. Catharine’s Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Intj.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—The
II<sup>nd</sup> Class. [Formerly it used to be a custom for
the II<sup>nd</sup> class to pursue the I<sup>st</sup> shouting “Gaits!
Gaits! Gai-ai-aits,” to which they replied, “<span class='sc'>Cats!
Cats!</span> Caa-ats!”] <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Dogs</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cat’s Head</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—The end of
a shoulder of mutton.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 84. His
meal [dinner] took place at six o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> in College (in Commoners’
it was at <i>one</i>); it was ample in quantity, and excellent in quality.
That of the Præfects was nicely served in joints, that of the Inferiors
was divided into portions (Dispars); there were, if I remember rightly,
six of these to a shoulder, and eight to a leg of mutton, the other
joints being divided in like proportion. All these “Dispars” had
different names; the thick slice out of the centre was called “a
Middle Cut,” that out of the shoulder a “Fleshy,” the ribs “Racks,”
the loin “Long Dispars”; these were the best, the more indifferent
were the end of the shoulder, or <span class='fss'>CAT’S HEAD</span>, the breast, or “Fat
Flab,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Cause-money</span>. Money paid for

<p class='c011'><i>Intj.</i> An exclamation of joy or pleasure.</p>

great schools whose scholars were accustomed on
the days of their patron Saints to challenge each

which was apparently the earliest form of what was
afterwards developed not only into the Westminster
<span class='sc'>Challenge</span>, but into the Eton <span class='sc'>Montem</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).]</p>

is commonly dialectical for bedroom.] <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Election
Chamber</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Charity-remove</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A “remove” assigned
to boys who have remained in the Form below for
several successive school quarters.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 297. The intention of these
<span class='fss'>CHARITY-REMOVES</span> (as they are called) is to prevent boys of dull
abilities being continually outstripped in the race of promotion by
boys younger than themselves; but practically the cases are very few
of boys who would be left in the same Form for above three quarters;
and even then the promotion is removed if the boy has been “notoriously
and ostentatiously” idle.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Charity-tails</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Tails</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Charlies</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—Thick gloves
made of twine. [Introduced by a Mr. Charles
Griffith: hence the name.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Chase</b>, <i>verb</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—To abscond; to run
away; as from school.</p>

<p class='c012'>1844. <i>Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital</i> [<i>The Blue</i>, Aug. 1874]. At length,
to the consternation and perplexity of the authorities, and the delight,
admiration, and envy of the fellows, this incorrigible character capped
all his former misdeeds by an act of pluck and daring which gained
for himself, from that time forth, all the honours of a hero—he
<span class='fss'>CHASED</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Chaw</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (University).—A trick; a device; a sell.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—A <span class='fss'>CAD</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); any non-member of
the school. Whence <span class='sc'>Worker-chaw</span> = the boy who
runs messages, &amp;c., for the work-shop. Also as <i>verb</i>

<p class='c010'><b>Check-nights</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—Rehearsals of the <span class='sc'>Fourth

Saturday in the boating season, when the crews
rowed up to Surly in their uniform and there
regaled themselves—the staple luxury being ducks

objection, and the custom has lately been done away
with.—<i>Etoniana</i> (1865).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cheese</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Schools and University).—An adept;

been adopted of late officially to designate the “Children” exclusively,
this usage has not extended to the school. “<span class='sc'>Child</span>” has fallen into

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Child</span>. Each of the

him (a nominal duty in recent times) at election time. These were
known as Warden’s <span class='fss'>CHILD</span>, Warden of New College’s <span class='fss'>CHILD</span>, &amp;c. Of
late the Head Master always chose for his <span class='fss'>CHILD</span> the head scholar in
Cloisters, and the Warden the second. Each <span class='fss'>CHILD</span> received a guinea
from the Elector who appointed him. The Children got off all fagging
on <span class='fss'>DOMUM DAY</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); at Election Dinner they sat at the same table
with Writers and Election Grace Singers, where the fare was better
than that served to the scholars generally; and they had wine and
dessert afterwards in <span class='fss'>CHILD’S</span>-room in the Warden’s house. Warden’s
<span class='fss'>CHILD</span> had during the following year the duty of applying to the
Head Master for every <span class='fss'>REMEDY</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), and half-remedy that came in
the ordinary course. In applying he used the set phrase, “The Præpostors’
duty, and they would be obliged for a remedy” (or “half-remedy”).
Whenever the application was something more than a
mere form, it was made by the Præfect of Hall, <i>e.g.</i> where a leave out

<p class='c010'><b>Chince</b> (or <b>Chinse</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A chance.

the site of the present one, but a part of it jutted into what is now
the end of the Higher Line Washing-place. Just outside this was a
flight of old oaken steps leading to the refectory. Beyond these stairs,
leading out to the back, there was a very old round-headed oaken

who must by no means be omitted, as they formed an important
part of the internal economy. I suppose they were called <span class='fss'>CHORISTERS</span>
because they had not to sing; certainly if ever that was a part of
their duty, it had entirely lapsed. Their office was to wait on
boys, in hall and chambers, till seven o’clock, and especially to go on
errands in the town,—the boys themselves never being allowed to go
there, except when invited by friends on Saints’ days. These little
<span class='fss'>CHORISTERS</span> wore chocolate-coloured tail-coats and trousers, with
metal buttons; and, on the whole, I think their life must have been a
weary one.... <i>Ibid.</i>, 189. The <span class='fss'>CHORISTERS</span> really do sing now, and
have not to run errands in the town for boys, but wait on them in the
hall instead.</p>

which the <span class='fss'>CHORISTERS</span> and college servants took their dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Chouse</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton and Winchester).—A shame; an

<p class='c012'>1864. <i>Athenæum.</i> When an Eton boy says that anything is “a
beastly <span class='fss'>CHOUSE</span>,” he means that it is a great shame; and when an
Eton peripatetic tradesman is playful enough to call his customer “a
little <span class='fss'>CHOUSER</span>,” he means that a leaf has been taken out of his own
book by one on whom he has practised.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Brinsley Richards</span>, <i>Seven Years at Eton</i>. The boy ... was
told that what he had done was an awful <span class='fss'>CHOUSE</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Hist. Eng. Dict.</i> [<span class='sc'>Murray</span>], <i>s.v.</i> <span class='fss'>CHOUSE</span>. “As to the origin
of the Eng. use, Gifford (1814), in a note on the quot. from Ben Jonson,
says, ‘In 1609, Sir Robt. Shirley sent a messenger or <span class='fss'>CHIAUS</span> to this
country, as his agent from the Grand Signior and the Sophy to transact
some preparatory business.’ The latter ‘<span class='fss'>CHIAUSED</span> the Turkish
and Persian merchants of £4000,’ and decamped. But no trace of this
incident has yet been found outside of Gifford’s note; it was unknown
to Peter Whalley, a previous editor of Ben Jonson, 1756; also to
Skinner, Henshaw, Dr. Johnson, Todd, and others who discussed the
history of the word. Yet most of these recognised the likeness of
<span class='fss'>CHOUSE</span> to the Turkish word, which Henshaw even proposed as the
etymon on the ground that the Turkish <span class='fss'>CHIAUS</span> ‘is little better than a
fool.’ Gifford’s note must therefore be taken with reserve.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Christians</b>, <i>subs. pl.</i> (Cambridge).—Fellows of Christ’s
College. [Derivation obvious.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Christopher</b> (Eton).—An old inn in Eton Street.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 23. On the great festivals ... they had permission
to spend part of the day in a country walk; not without a strong
caution (so similar are the temptations of schoolboys and the anxieties
of masters in all ages) against turning into taverns and beer-shops by
the way. The “Tap” and the <span class='fss'>CHRISTOPHER</span> had their earlier
prototypes....</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Chuck</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Westminster). <i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1864. <span class='sc'>Hotten</span>, <i>Slang Dict.</i>, s.v. A schoolboy’s treat.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Chucks!</b> <i>intj.</i> (general).—A signal of a master’s approach.
A French equivalent is <i>Vesse!</i></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Circum.</b> <span class='sc'>To go circum</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester). <i>See</i>
quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 23 [<i>temp.</i> 1570]. At five the
school was dismissed, and the whole resident society—warden, fellows,
masters, and scholars—went in procession round the cloisters and the
whole interior circuit of the college, which was called <span class='fss'>GOING CIRCUM</span>.
Thus they passed into the hall, where a supper of mutton was served—one
dispar to every three boys.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clacken</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.).—A wooden
bat about two feet long with a thin handle and
rounded head (<i>e.g.</i>
<img class="inline" src="images/i_052_inline.png" alt="clacken" />
), flat on both sides,
originally used for the game of <i>hails</i>. The game
is no longer played at the school, but survives in
the Edin. Academy. [A “Hail” in Scotland denotes
the place from which a ball is driven off at
the commencement of a game. “Clacken” is from
“clack,” the clapper of a mill.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clarian</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—A member of Clare Hall,
Cambridge; also <span class='sc'>Greyhound</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1889. <span class='sc'>C. Whibley</span>, <i>Cap and Gown</i>. E’en stuke-struck <span class='fss'>CLARIANS</span>
strove to stoop.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Classicus</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A Junior in each <span class='sc'>Part</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>): his duty is to get lessons set, &amp;c. <span class='sc'>Classicus-paper</span>
= <span class='fss'>CUSE</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clean-straw</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Clean sheets. [Before
1540 the beds were bundles of straw on a stone
floor. At that date Dean Fleshmonger put in oaken
floors, and provided proper beds, such as existed in
1871 in Third, and later in the case of the Præfect
of Hall’s unused beds in Sixth. The term is never
used in reference to mattresses of any kind, straw
or other.] The dormitory arrangements are now
thoroughly modernised.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clipe</b>, <i>verb</i> (general).—To tell tales; to “split”; to
peach.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clodding</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—A ceremony of initiation [put
down by Dr. Wooll, <i>temp.</i> 1808-28] performed on
those who were promoted into the Fifth. They
had to run along the course of a small gutter which
flowed from the cow-sheds (<i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Barn-school</span>),
through a double line of boys, who pelted them
with clods of clay moistened in that not very
delicate stream. Unpopular boys had these clods
specially hardened for their benefit—it was even
said with stones inside. On promotion from the
Fourth to the Remove a boy had to run the
gauntlet up and down the big school between a
double line of his fellows, armed with handkerchiefs
tied in “Westminster knots.” He was allowed
to protect himself with books stuffed inside his
trousers; but the punishment was fearful.—<span class='sc'>Collins.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cloister-peals</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Peals</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cloister-roush</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 117. We
had some singular customs at the commencement of Cloister time.
Senior part and Cloisters, just before the entrance of the Masters into
School, used to engage in a kind of general tournament; this was called
<span class='fss'>CLOISTER-ROUSH</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cloisters</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The name given to
Middle and Junior Part of Fifth <span class='sc'>Book</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), when
combined together in <span class='sc'>Cloister-time</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 24. But the younger commoners
probably seldom came into school, being taught chiefly in the
chamber of the warden or fellow under whose charge they were
placed; and in summer-time the whole of the scholars usually adjourned
for lessons into the adjacent <span class='fss'>CLOISTERS</span>: a delightful arrangement,
from which the latter portion of the “long-half” is still called
<span class='fss'>CLOISTER-TIME</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cloister-time</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Ten or twelve weeks
at the latter end of Long Half, commencing about
Whitsunday and ending at <span class='sc'>Standing-up week</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Clow</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Pronounced <i>clō</i>. A box on
the ear. [Possibly from <i>clout</i>. <span class='sc'>Halliwell</span>, <i>clow</i>
(Cumberland) = to scratch. Also <i>clew</i> (Glouc.) = a
blow.] Also as <i>verb</i>: it was customary to preface
the action by an injunction to “hold down.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 140. The
juniors did not get much fun out of the regular games, as their part
consisted solely in kicking in the ball, and receiving divers kicks and
<span class='fss'>CLOWS</span> in return for their vigilance. <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 39. Nor, when ordered
to “hold down” (<i>i.e.</i> put your head in a convenient position) for a
<span class='fss'>CLOW</span>, would the victim dare to ward off the blow.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Club-keeper</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A Captain of the side
in a game: at cricket or football.</p>

<p class='c012'>1820-5. <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span> [<i>Letter</i>, 1889]. The old ground which we
played upon was too much upon a slope, and when I was one of the
<span class='sc'>Club-keepers</span>, and head of the eleven, a considerable sum was spent
in endeavouring to improve it, and we succeeded in levelling a sufficient
space for a tolerably good wicket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Coach</b>, <i>subs.</i> (formerly University and Public Schools:
now common).—A private tutor; and in a transferred
sense one who trains another in mental or
physical acquirements: <i>e.g.</i> in Sanskrit, Shakspeare,
cricket, or rowing. Analagous terms are <span class='sc'>Crammer</span>,
<span class='sc'>Feeder</span>, and <span class='sc'>Grinder</span>. Also as <i>verb</i> = to prepare
for an examination by private instruction; to train:
in general use both by coacher and coachee.</p>

<p class='c012'>1846. <span class='sc'>Thackeray</span>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, ch. v. The superb Cuff himself ...

the regular college tutor, I secured the assistance of what, in the

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>C. Bede</span>, <i>Verdant Green</i>, pt. <span class='fss'>I.</span>, pp. 63-4. “That man is
Cram, the patent safety. He’s the first <span class='fss'>COACH</span> in Oxford.” “A

didn’t know college slang. I suppose a royal mail is the only gentleman
<span class='fss'>COACH</span> <i>you</i> know of. Why, in Oxford a <span class='fss'>COACH</span> means a private

<p class='c012'>1871. <i>Times</i>, “Report of the Debate in House of Lords on
University Test Bill.” The test proposed would be wholly ineffective;
... while it would apply to the college tutors, who had little influence

the chief direction of their studies.</p>

<p class='c012'>1889. <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 29th Nov., p. 1, col. 3. The schoolmaster is

<p class='c010'><b>Coat.</b> <span class='sc'>To get one’s coat</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Harrow).—To
be made a member of the “Sixth Form Game”;
the equivalent of the “Twenty-two” at other
schools: cricket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cob</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A hard hit at cricket; a
slogger: a recent introduction. Also as <i>verb</i> (common),
to detect; to catch.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb.</i> 1. (Stonyhurst).—To purloin oranges, &amp;c.,
after a <span class='sc'>Do</span> (<i>q.v.</i>): <i>e.g.</i> “<span class='sc'>Cob</span> for me,” sometimes
whispered by an envious disappointed one to a
fortunate friend as he goes into the “Do-room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—In the verbal sense of <span class='fss'>COB</span> = to
detect; to catch (<i>see</i> subs., <i>ante</i>); the practice at
Harrow is almost always to use the word in the
passive, with “badly”: <i>e.g.</i> “I was badly <span class='fss'>COBBED</span>
‘tollying-up’” (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cock</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—An elevation from which, at
football, a <span class='fss'>GUARDER</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) kicks balls which “go
out”: it corresponds to the “tee” at golf.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To be cocked up</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Charterhouse).—<i>See</i>
quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, 85. Fags [at Old Charterhouse] had to
fag in reality at cricket; they got <span class='fss'>COCKED UP</span> if they cut, and they
got <span class='fss'>COCKED UP</span> if they missed a catch, or muffed a ball. A stump
was always handy.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cock-house</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general). A champion house; as at
cricket, football—anything.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 95. (Harrow) The various Houses are
divided into “Upper Round” Houses (being those which possess a
member of the School Eleven at the beginning of the term), and
“Lower Round” Houses (being those which possess no member of the
School Eleven at the beginning of the term). The “Upper Round”
Houses are drawn together, and play against each other; and the
same course is pursued with regard to the “Lower Round” Houses.
When all these ties are played off, the winner of the “Upper Round”
plays the winner of the “Lower Round” for <span class='fss'>COCK-HOUSE</span>. A silver
challenge cup is presented to the <span class='fss'>COCK-HOUSE</span> of the year.</p>

<p class='c012'>1898. <span class='sc'>Warner</span> in <i>Harrow School</i>, 271. Coming back from the
holidays a boy will eagerly discuss with his comrades the prospects of

or cricket—and no chance is too small on which to build a mighty
castle of hope.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cockloft, The</b> (Harrow).—A small room at the top
of the Old Schools; in turn a school-room or the
limbo for the <span class='sc'>School-stock</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) of confiscated
books.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cocks</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—The old washing place.
[Early in the century a leaden trough, into which
six taps discharged water, was fixed in a corner of
Writing School, behind a partition which was constructed
to hold Gownboys Library. These taps
suggested the term <span class='fss'>COCKS</span>. Formerly Gownboys
washed at the pump.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cocoa-club</b>, <i>subs.</i> (The Leys).—Afternoon tea, &amp;c., at

to an <span class='sc'>Oppidan</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <i>Public School Mag.</i>, Nov., p. 367. The discussion continues
as to whether the <span class='fss'>COLLEGERS</span> should compete for the House Cup. As
we have always said, this seems a ridiculous suggestion. If <span class='fss'>COLLEGE</span>
is on a separate foundation to the Oppidans, we can see no reason for
them to desire to join in competing for Oppidan events.</p>

Admitted after a severe competitive examination, and specially encouraged

offered to Etonians, and maintain the high reputation of their old
school in the class lists at Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>College-ware</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Crockery that falls
without breaking.—<span class='sc'>Mansfield.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Combie</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—The “Combination room,”
a parlour in which college dons drink wine after
Hall.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Come.</b> <span class='sc'>Come up!</span> <i>intj.</i> (Sherborne).—The order given
by the Captain of the Games, after 3 Roll on a

<p class='c010'><b>Come-up</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A regulation as to the
conditions by which one player might try to take
the ball from another: football.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Commoner</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—A boy not on the foundation.
Whence (Winchester) <span class='sc'>Commoners</span> = the
building they lived in. [Now abolished as a
residence and converted into class-rooms with a
handsome library. The old building, which presented
externally (<i>vide</i> <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>) the appearance
of an inferior workhouse, was successfully
altered by Mr. <span class='sc'>Butterfield</span>, and is now, in its
architecture, worthy of its purpose and surroundings.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 26. Of the fellow-commoners,
or <span class='fss'>COMMONERS</span>, as they are now termed, who have so increased
as to form a supplementary body of scholars doubling in number the
College boys themselves, it will be necessary to give some account.
Provision had been made in the original statutes for the reception and
instruction of independent students to the number of ten, sons of
noblemen or of “special friends” of the College, who, though not
claiming the other advantages of the foundation, might yet wish to
avail themselves of its sound teaching; with a proviso that these should
not be in any way burdensome to the revenues.... In [Dr. Burton’s]
time the College rose rapidly as a place of education for many of the
young nobility, and the accommodations were found insufficient. He
built what is now remembered by Wykehamists of the past generation
as “<span class='fss'>OLD COMMONERS</span>.” ... The number of <span class='fss'>COMMONERS</span> gradually
increased, until in 1820 they reached 135. “<span class='sc'>Old Commoners</span>” was
pulled down in 1839-41 to make way for the present building, which
was the result of a general Wykehamist subscription. <i>Ibid.</i>, 115
[Westminster]. In every public school the masters were entirely
dependent for any income beyond their statutable salaries on the
liberality of the parents of those boys who were admitted as <span class='fss'>COMMONERS</span>,
or oppidans. <i>Ibid.</i>, <i>Etoniana</i>, 10. [At Eton] there were two
classes of these boys—“<i>generosorum filii Commensales</i>,” and simple
“<i>Commensales</i>”—corresponding to the “gentleman-<span class='fss'>COMMONER</span>” and
“<span class='fss'>COMMONER</span>” of Oxford; the former probably of higher social rank,
paying more for their commons, and dining at a separate table.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Commoner-grub</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A dinner formerly
given by <span class='fss'>COMMONERS</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) to College after
cricket matches.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Commoners-speaking</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The day
on which the speakers, selected from among the
<span class='sc'>Inferiors</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), declaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Common Innings</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A form
of cricket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Common-time</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The Short Half,
and beginning of Long up to Easter time.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Commons</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—Rations of bread, butter,
and milk, supplied from the buttery. [When a
number of men breakfast together, the student
whose rooms are the rendezvous tells his scout the
names of those <i>in</i>-college men who are coming to
breakfast with him. The scout then collects their
<span class='fss'>COMMONS</span>, which thus forms the substratum of the
entertainment. The other things are of course
supplied by the giver of the breakfast, and are sent
in by the confectioner. As to the knives and forks
and crockery, the scout produces them from his
common stock.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span>, <i>Verdant Green</i>, viii. Of course you’d like to take
out an æger, sir; and I can bring you your <span class='fss'>COMMONS</span> just the same.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Compo</b>, <i>subs.</i> (King Edward’s, Birm.).—The championship
competition in the gymnasium, or at fives;
place-kicking.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Compositions</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—Three days coming
at the end of each quarter, during which the
composition work of the various Forms is tested.
According to the results is arranged the “Order of
Compositions,” which is accepted as fixing a boy’s
place in his Form for the ensuing quarter. There
is a hill some distance from the College known as
“Composition Hill,” so called because the Poets
(<i>q.v.</i>) went there for inspiration on composition days.
The first and second boys according to the order of
Compositions are known respectively as “Roman
Imperator” and “Carthaginian Imperator.” The
last Compositions of the year used to be known as
the “Great Compositions.” By them the Form
medals, &amp;c., were decided.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Compound-kish</b> (or <b>Hish</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Marlborough).—The
rules of the Latin compound sentence.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Compul</b>, <i>adj.</i> and <i>adv.</i> (Harrow).—That is, “compulsory.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Compulsory</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Runabout</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Con</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Winchester).—A rap on the head with the
knuckles, or with anything hard, such as a cricket
ball. Also as <i>verb</i>: to rap with the knuckles.
[The derivation formerly accepted at Winchester
was κονδυλον = a knuckle, but the editors of the
<i>Wykehamist</i> suggest its origin in the North
Country <i>con</i>, “to fillip,” with which the French
<i>se cogner</i> exactly corresponds.]</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (general).—That is, “construe.” Hence <span class='fss'>TO GET
A CONSTRUE</span> = to get some one to translate a piece.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Conduct</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—A chaplain.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 163. I was stopped on my
entry into school by the “Minos.” The title of “<span class='fss'>CONDUCT</span>,” by
which the chaplains of Eton College are known, was for many years
ludicrously misprinted by the successive editors of Horace Walpole’s
Letters, who made him talk of “standing funking over against a
conduit to be catechised.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Conduit</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—(1) In College, a water-tap;
(2) in Commoners, a lavatory.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Continent</b>, <i>adv.</i> (Winchester).—Ill; on the sick-list: <i>cf.</i>

an office in the patronage of the Commoner Præfects, the
duties of which were principally connected with the organisation of
the fagging department. He was required to have been three years

His privileges were numerous, the principal being that he was allowed

<p class='c012'>1872. <i>Daily News</i>, Dec. 20. Competitive examinations for the

<p class='c010'><b>Crick, The</b> (Rugby). <i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 182. <span class='sc'>The crick</span> is the most celebrated
of all school runs. Everybody, I fancy, in the running world has
heard of it. On a day at the end of the Christmas term—generally
on the first Thursday in December—you may see all the School
assembled at the “Quad gates.”... <span class='sc'>The crick</span> is only run once a
year. Its course is along roads and footpaths to Crick village, and then
back by Hillmorton, the finish being a length of about a third of a
mile along the Hillmorton Road. It is a race pure and simple; and is
in this respect a race against time.... The length of the race is supposed
to be about eleven or twelve miles, and the time in which it is
run is generally between an hour and twenty minutes and an hour and
a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cricket-bill</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A “call-over” on the
cricket-ground. All fall into line, down which a

stated by the <span class='sc'>Shepherds</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cricket-Quarter</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Long

<p class='c010'><b>Croc</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cheltenham).—A ladies’ school when
walking out.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Crocketts</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A kind of bastard
cricket, sometimes called “small <span class='fss'>CROCKETTS</span>.” A
stump was used and a fives ball, with a bat of plain
deal about two inches broad, or a broomstick. <span class='sc'>To
get crocketts</span> = to fail to score; to get a “duck’s
egg.” <i>Cf.</i> <span class='sc'>Books</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Crow</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A master. [From the black

<p class='c010'><b>Crown</b> (Charterhouse).—The school tuck-shop.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, 96. At Old Charterhouse the word
<span class='fss'>CROWN</span>, with a sort of coronet above it, was painted in large white
letters on a wall near the racket courts. The story is that the Crown
Inn once stood just outside this wall.... When the inn was pulled
down, Lord Ellenborough, then a boy in the school, painted a crown on
a wall near the place where the inn had stood. Years after, on his
return from India, being touched to find his boyish work still in
existence, he expressed a hope that it might never be allowed to
vanish; so it has been painted again from time to time, and Merchant
Taylors’ still keep it fresh. This “<span class='fss'>CROWN</span>” was not near the tuck-shop,
which was a grimy cellar under the old school, with the face of
a disused clock for a signboard, and the superscription, “<span class='fss'>NO TICK
HERE</span>.” But it was thought fit that the memory of this old word
should be kept up somehow and somewhere at the new school, so a
large theatrical-looking crown was suspended, like a tavern sign, outside
the school tuck-shop in the pavilion. In this way the name and
memory of this bit of antiquity are preserved.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Crow Wood</b> (Stonyhurst).—A wood in the Park.</p>

<p class='c012'>1884. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, June, p. 294. The churn was in the latter
days [1834] turned by a wheel worked by water supplied from the
<span class='fss'>CROW WOOD</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Crug</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—At Hertford, a crust;
in the London school, crust and crumb alike.</p>

<p class='c012'>1820. <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>, <i>Elia</i> (<i>Christ’s Hospital</i>) [<i>Works</i> (1852), 322]. He had

<p class='c011'>2. <span class='sc'>A Blue</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); especially an “old boy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1877. <span class='sc'>Blanch</span>, <i>Blue-Coat Boys</i>, p. 80. All <span class='fss'>CRUGS</span> will well remember,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cruganaler</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—A biscuit given
on St. Matthew’s Day. [Orthography dubious.
Blanch inclines to the following derivation: “The
biscuit had once something to do with those nights
when bread and beer, with cheese, were substituted
for bread-and-butter and milk. Thence the term
‘crug and aler.’ The only argument against this is
the fact that the liquid was never dignified with
the name of ale, but was invariably called ‘the
swipes.’ By another derivation = ‘hard as nails.’
It is then spelt <span class='fss'>CRUGGYNAILER</span>.”] Obsolete.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cruggy</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—Hungry. [From <span class='fss'>CRUG</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>).]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Crump</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A hard hit; a fall. Also
as <i>verb</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cud</b>, <i>adj.</i> 1. (Winchester).—Pretty; handsome. [A
suggested derivation is from κυδος; another is the
A.S. <i>cuð</i>, the Scots <i>couthie</i>, and whence <i>cuðle</i>, to
cuddle (a derivative of <i>cuð</i>), the meaning formerly
given to a verbal usage of <span class='fss'>CUD</span> at Winchester.]</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Christ’s Hospital).—Severe. Whence <span class='fss'>CUDDY</span>
= hard: difficult; said of a lesson. Also <i>Hertfordicé</i>
for <span class='fss'>PASSY</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). [There is a common hard
biscuit called a “cuddy-biscuit” which doubtless
has this derivation.] Obsolete.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Culminate</b>, <i>verb</i> (University: obsolete).—To mount a
coach-box.</p>

<p class='c012'>1803. <i>Gradus ad Cantabrigiam</i>, s.v.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cup-fag</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A boy whose duty it is
to place the challenge cups, should his House have
any, in their cases each morning, and remove them
to a safe place every night. He has also to keep
them clean, and for neglect of any of these duties
he is fined. He receives a quarterly payment for
his services, and is exempt from other forms of
fagging.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Curtain.</b> <span class='sc'>Above the curtain</span>, <i>phr.</i> (Westminster).—<i>See</i>
quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 108. A curtain formerly was
drawn across the school, dividing the upper forms from the lower.
One day a boy was so unlucky as to tear it; and Busby’s known
severity left no doubt of the punishment that would follow. The
offender was in despair, when a generous schoolfellow volunteered to
take the blame upon himself and suffered in his friend’s stead
accordingly.... In three year’s time he was sufficiently advanced to
be admitted by Busby <span class='fss'>ABOVE THE CURTAIN</span>—that is, into the fourth
class, the lowest in the upper school. Of this class, however, he says
the head-master “took little or no care,” but as he rose into the higher
forms he found the teaching more satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cuse</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A book in which a record is
kept of the “marks” in each division; a <span class='fss'>CLASSICUS
PAPER</span> (<i>q.v.</i>): also used for the weekly order.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Custos</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—The official who looks after all
arrangements in the way of stationery, &amp;c., keeps
the keys, cuts names on the House-boards, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>Also <i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Admonishing-money</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cut</b>, <i>verb</i> (general).—To avoid; to absent oneself from:
<i>e.g.</i> <span class='fss'>TO CUT LECTURE</span>, <span class='fss'>TO CUT CHAPEL</span>, <span class='fss'>TO CUT HALL</span>,
<span class='fss'>TO CUT GATES</span>. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To cut into</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester).—Originally
to hit one with a “ground ash.” The office
was exercised by Bible-clerks upon a man kicking
up a row when up to Books. Now generally used
in the sense of to correct in a less formal manner
than <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To cut in a book</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester).—<i>See</i>
quot.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866). <span class='sc'>Cut in a
book.</span>—A method of drawing lots. A certain letter was fixed on (<i>e.g.</i>
the first in the second line on the left page), each boy then turned over
a leaf, and whoever turned over the leaf in which the corresponding
letter was nearest to <span class='fss'>A</span>, won.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Cuts</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—Flannel trousers; <span class='fss'>SHORTS</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

held at the beginning of term.</p>
<div class='clearme'>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To be a <span class='fss'>DAB</span> = to be skilled at anything.
Hence, the two entrance examinations, one
at the end of term, and the other at the
very beginning of the next, are the <span class='fss'>SKEW</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)
and the <span class='fss'>DAB</span> respectively. The <span class='fss'>DAB</span> offers no
second chance; hence a bad candidate tries the
“skew” first.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Dame</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—A mathematical or other master
(except a classical) who keeps a boarding-house for
boys in College. Also (obsolete) at Harrow. <i>See</i>
Appendix, and quot. 1867.</p>

<p class='c012'>1786-1805. <span class='sc'>Tooke</span>, <i>Parley</i>, 390, s.v. <span class='sc'>Battel</span>. A term used at Eton
for the small portion of food which in addition to the College allowance
the Collegers receive from their <span class='fss'>DAMES</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 133. Formerly these [boarding] houses were almost
entirely kept by “<span class='fss'>DAMES</span>” or “Dominies”—the latter being the old
style when there was a male head of the establishment, though now
the term “DAMES” applies to all without reference to sex. Tutors
and assistant-masters used to live in most of these houses, but had no
charge over the boys. Only the lower master and some of the
senior assistant-masters kept houses of their own. There are now
twenty boarding-houses kept by masters, and ten by “<span class='fss'>DAMES</span>”—of
whom four only are ladies.</p>

<p class='c012'>1866-72. “<span class='sc'>Mac</span>,” <i>Sketchy Memories of Eton</i> (1885). I am thankful
to say that I did not attend the show. But I happened to see the

The punishment inflicted had been very considerable, and I do not
think the World appeared in public for quite a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i> [Harrow], p. 293. All these
[sixteen boarding-houses other than the head-master’s] are kept by
assistant-masters, and form one considerable source of their income.
No <span class='fss'>DAMES’</span> boarding-houses are now sanctioned; and for the good
order of his establishment each master is responsible.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 16. Until recently some of the boarding-houses
were kept by assistant-masters, the remainder by “dominies”
or “<span class='fss'>DAMES</span>,” who took no part in the work of education, and had
little or no disciplinary jurisdiction. The boys, therefore, who
boarded in <span class='fss'>DAMES’</span> houses had as their tutors assistant-masters residing
elsewhere. Now, although there remains only one female <span class='fss'>DAME</span>,
the teachers of mathematics, science, and French are for some purposes
accounted <span class='fss'>DAMES</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1866-72. “<span class='sc'>Mac</span>,” <i>Sketchy Memories of Eton</i> (1885). Meanwhile, “regardless
of our doom, we little victims played,” or rather watched the

head-master of Eton and the Rev. F. W. Cornish lay in ambush for
our outcoming behind that very sharp turn in the High Street, which,
on account of its acute angle, and the consequent danger of being
nailed in shirking in old days, was somewhat flippantly termed <span class='fss'>DAMNATION-CORNER</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Dancing Gallery, The</b> (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The old

Lady’s Gallery,” which in former times was designated <span class='fss'>THE DANCING
GALLERY</span>. It is by competent judges pronounced to be one of the
finest bits of “Baronial Gothic” architecture in England, but the
door is quite a solecism, for it is of a much later design.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Dark Walk, The</b> (Stonyhurst).—A long avenue of tall
yew trees in the garden. Tradition says the last of
the Shireburns was poisoned by eating some of the

<p class='c012'>1885. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, i. 179. The <span class='fss'>DARK WALK</span> formerly extended

came it was found necessary to encroach upon the gardens to make
room for the playgrounds, and a certain part of the <span class='fss'>DARK WALK</span> was

<p class='c012'>1886. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, iii. 18. <span class='sc'>Double puff</span>, ... a game played
after the fashion of “tip and run,” except that instead of a wicket and
tennis ball a Stonyhurst cricket bat is used, and a ball about the size
of an ordinary <span class='fss'>BANDY</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) ball, made of soft material and covered
with sheepskin, which made it very hard to hit far, and still harder
either to catch, or to pick up and throw in.... The distance between
the wickets is not as long as in wicket cricket; and the rule about
bowling is the same as in Stonyhurst cricket, namely, under-arm and
not waiting till the batsman is ready. It used to be played a good
many years ago on Sunday afternoons, between Vespers and supper;
and the community used to come out in large numbers to play it.</p>

Catharine’s College.</p>

<p class='c012'>1889. <span class='sc'>C. Whibley</span>, <i>Three Centuries of Cambridge Wit</i>, p. xxix. It
is said that the members of St. Catharine’s Hall were first of all called
“Puritans” from the derivation of the name of their patroness from
καθαίρειν. The “dove” being the emblem of purity, to change a
name from “Puritans” to <span class='fss'>DOVES</span> was but one short step.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Dowlings</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Shrewsbury).—Football.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Pascoe</span>, <i>Life at our Public Schools</i>. There are four or five

rather than boating. <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Wet-bob</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1839. <span class='sc'>Buckland</span> [<i>Macmillan’s Mag.</i> (Nov. 1889), “Eton Fifty Years
Ago”]. It was the ambition of most boys to be a wet-bob, and to be
“in the boats.” The school was divided between wet-bobs and <span class='fss'>DRY-BOBS</span>,
the former taking their pleasure on the river, and the latter in
the cricket-field.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Duchess’ Rooms</b> (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A section of
the old College once inhabited by a Dowager
Duchess of Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c012'>1885. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, ii. 100. The whole of this building ...
stood in what is now the back court.... It was entirely of wood and
plaster, in the style denominated “post and pattern.” The Duchess
of Norfolk, the last of the Shireburns, daughter of Sir Nicholas, resided
in it, hence the name of <span class='fss'>THE DUCHESS’ ROOMS</span> by which it was
last known. She faced the front of the wooden building with stone,
and inserted sash windows, a style then coming into fashion.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Dubs</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Winchester).—Double.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Duck</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Winchester).—The face. <span class='sc'>To make a

term, and for two weeks after the boys go back in September. For
those who care for swimming there are inter-House swimming matches;
and each House elects <span class='fss'>DUCKS</span> (boys over sixteen) and <span class='fss'>DUCKLINGS</span>
(boys under sixteen) to compete for Cock-House.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ducker, The</b> (Harrow).—The school bathing-place beyond
the Footer Fields: the largest artificial open-air
bathing place in England. Originally the
<span class='sc'>Duck-puddle</span>. [Probably the first example of the

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 322. Bathing was always,
until very lately, practised under difficulties at Harrow. The common
bathing-place, known as <span class='fss'>DUCK-PUDDLE</span> ... was a long piece of muddy
water, varying from four to eight feet in depth. There, after it had
been stirred up by all possible means into more of a puddle than usual,
new boys were formally dipped.... To avoid mixing in the general
wash at <span class='fss'>DUCK-PUDDLE</span>, many boys used to go out to the Brent at
Perivale, or even as far as Ellestree reservoir, for bathing; and these
were favourite expeditions on the mornings of Saints’ days. But Dr.
Vaughan had the old “puddle” lined with brick, and supplied with
water by a steam-engine, to the great additional comfort of the bathers.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ducks</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Football knickerbockers. [Made

the regular weekly half-holidays, there are others
specially granted, known as <span class='fss'>EARLY</span> and <span class='fss'>LATE PLAYS</span>.
The latter, given by the head-master at his discretion,
consists in the remission of all school work after eleven <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> But an
<span class='fss'>EARLY PLAY</span>—when school is “up” at nine—is a much more formal
indulgence, accorded by very ancient custom only to the personal
request of some visitor of distinction. St. David’s Day (March 1st)
and St. Patrick’s (March 17) have always been holidays of this class:
for the former, the late and the present Sir Watkin Wynn have always
come down to Westminster; and for the latter, the late Marquess of
Lansdowne (as an Irish peer) and Sir Everard Home. The custom,
even now observed on some occasions, was for the visitor’s arrival at
the gate to be formally announced to the head-master by Monos, who
received a “tip” for his services. The master at once “came down
school,” and reappeared through the great door, accompanied by the
hero of the day, who was received by the boys with great demonstrations
of welcome, expressed by the vigorous rapping of books on the
desks. Both knelt down side by side, while the “monitor of school,”
kneeling immediately in front of them, proceeded with the usual school
prayers. The visitor then “begged a play,” which was granted. The
applause was renewed, and acknowledged by a bow, after which the
whole of the boys rushed joyously down school, the masters following
in more grave and stately fashion. The visits of the “King of North
Wales” were doubly popular, since he presented every Welsh boy with
a sovereign—a custom which the present baronet liberally continues.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ecky</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Manchester Grammar).—Exercise.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Egg</b> (or <b>Egg-up</b>), <i>verb</i> (Marlborough).—To show ostentatious

<p class='c010'><b>Egg-flip Day</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The Founder’s Commemoration
Day. [Because a favourite beverage
at the festivities succeeding the great annual football
match played on that day between the “first
sixes” of Commoners and College was “Egg-flip.”]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Eggotty</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Felsted).—Used as follows: A boy seen
carrying an egg or eggs, if addressed by another as
“<span class='fss'>EGGOTTY</span>,” might, must in fact, almost in honour,
throw an egg at him. If the egg-owner was a good
shot he would invite his friend “call me <span class='fss'>EGGOTTY</span>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 164. From about 8 to 10
he [the fag] is supposed to be at work, in a sort of common room
assigned to the juniors collectively, preparing his lessons for next day;
but the call of “<span class='fss'>ELECTION</span>,” which signifies that the services of one
of the junior election is required by one of the seniors, used to be
frequent enough to be a very serious interruption. It is admitted that
these demands upon a junior’s time have commonly been such that
“a boy tempted to be idle, as most of them are, finds very considerable
difficulty in doing his work.” In order to check these interruptions
as far as possible, a late regulation has made all fagging
unlawful during these evening hours of work.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To gain a year by election</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester).—A
boy not being a <span class='sc'>Founder</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) was
obliged to leave at the Election immediately succeeding
his eighteenth birthday; he whose birthday
came shortly after Election, was thus enabled to
stay till he was nearly nineteen, and was so said
“to gain a year.”—<span class='sc'>Mansfield</span> (<i>c.</i> 1840).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Electors</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The Warden and two
Fellows of New College, and the Warden, Sub-Warden,

conducted <span class='sc'>Election</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).—<span class='sc'>Mansfield</span> (<i>c.</i> 1840).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Elegant Extracts</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—Students who,
though “plucked,” were still given their degrees.
A line was drawn below the poll-list, and those
allowed to pass were nicknamed the <span class='fss'>ELEGANT EXTRACTS</span>.
There was a similar limbo in the honour-list.</p>

dinner-time the <span class='sc'>Inferiors</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) were divided into six companies,
each being presided over by a <i>Candlekeeper</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). These companies
and the table at which they sat were called <span class='fss'>ENDS</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1834. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>History of Christ’s Hospital</i>. <span class='sc'>The great and
little erasmus forms</span> get their respectable and respective titles
from the fact that their tenants in old time studied the larger and
smaller Colloquies of the learned Erasmus.</p>

<p class='c012'>1870-95. <i>More Gleanings from</i> <span class='sc'>The Blue</span>, 191. <span class='sc'>The Great Erasmus.</span>—The
origin of a name is seldom what one thinks it ought to be.
Those of us who rejoice in being able to write after our names the
mystic letters, L.E.<i>x.</i>, L.E.<i>y.</i>, L.E.<i>z.</i>, are distinguished from our less
fortunate neighbours by the lightning fluency with which we are able
to talk secrets in Greek. <span class='sc'>Erasmus</span> is a Greek word, and the Dutchman,
thanks to a visit to Oxford, became so great a scholar in Greek,
that he was appointed first Regius Professor of Greek in the University
of Cambridge.... Unfortunately, this is all wrong as far as the
<span class='fss'>LITTLE ERAS.</span> are concerned, for they were not called <span class='fss'>ERAS.</span> because
they knew Greek, but because they read Latin.... Erasmus did a
kindness to Christ’s Hospital long after his death in having written a
number of “Colloquies,” conversations between typical characters of
his day, in clear and faultless Latin.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ewe-lamb</b>, <i>subs.</i> (The Leys).—A school hour in which a
Master or Prefect has no appointed lesson.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ex</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—(1) An exercise of any sort; and
(2) an <span class='fss'>EXEAT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). Also (Charterhouse) in sense
2, but <i>not</i> <span class='fss'>EXTRA</span>, sense 3 (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Exeat</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (general).—Written permission to go
away from School or College either at the end or
during the term for a longer period than a day.
<i>Cf.</i> <span class='sc'>Absit</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1886. <span class='sc'>Dickens</span>, <i>Dict. of Cambridge</i>, 3. No undergraduate should
go down without obtaining his <span class='fss'>EXEAT</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Charterhouse).—An interval in the middle
of each of the three terms of the school year; it
was instituted so that there might be no leaving
at odd times. It lasts from noon on Saturday to
6.45 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on the following Monday. Formerly
Upper School had a <span class='sc'>going-out Saturday</span> every
week, and the Under School one every other week,
and leave lasted from noon on Saturday till Sunday
evening chapel. Also at Harrow a similar term of
leave.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Exercises</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Sherborne: obsolete).—Ordinary Form

<p class='c010'><b>Explain.</b> <span class='sc'>Don’t explain!</span> <i>intj.</i> (The Leys).—An injunction

when those <span class='fss'>SENT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) copy out Latin grammar for
two hours and a half: an extreme punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—An extra day’s <span class='fss'>BOY</span> (<i>q.v.</i>): given
to those who <span class='fss'>CUT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) when “on boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>3. (Charterhouse).—Extra school: it lasts from
2 to 4 every Wednesday afternoon. The ways of
procuring admission to it are various: to neglect a
<span class='fss'>REP</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) or a “construe,” to be late for anything,
to make a noise in the cubicles, to come into school
in slippers, or any misdemeanour leads to a boy
being “down for <span class='fss'>EXTRA</span>.” The entries are kept in
... <span class='sc'>The Black Book</span>. <span class='sc'>Extra</span> school is for offences
committed during the first part of the week. There
is also <span class='sc'>Extra</span> drill on Saturdays in Scholars’ Court,
which lasts half the time of <span class='sc'>Extra</span> school, and which
is much more disliked, for offences committed between
a Thursday and a Saturday.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Extra Drill</b>, <i>subs.</i> (The Leys).—Imposed by way of
punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ex Trumps</b>, <i>adv. phr.</i> (Winchester).—Extempore. <span class='sc'>To

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866),
37. The duties of a <span class='fss'>FAG</span>, in the days of which I write,
may be more easily described by informing the reader
what he had not to do, than by endeavouring to make out a list of his
positive duties. I believe when I say that he had not to make the beds,
nor to clean shoes, I have exhausted the negative catalogue.</p>

<p class='c012'>1855. <span class='sc'>Thackeray</span>, <i>Newcomes</i>, ch. xviii. Bob Trotter, the diminutive
<span class='fss'>FAG</span> of the studio, who ran on all the young men’s errands, and
fetched them in apples, oranges, and walnuts.</p>

<p class='c012'>1856. <span class='sc'>Hughes</span>, <i>Tom Brown’s School-days</i>, vii. These were the principal
duties of the <span class='fss'>FAGS</span> in the house. From supper until nine o’clock
three <span class='fss'>FAGS</span> taken in order stood in the passages, and answered any
præposter who called “Fag,” racing to the door, the last comer having
to do the work. This consisted generally of going to the buttery for
beer and bread and cheese (for the great men did not sup with the
rest, but had each his own allowance in his study or the fifth-form
room), cleaning candlesticks and putting in new candles, toasting
cheese, bottling beer, and carrying messages about the house....
And besides this nightwork, each præpostor had three or four fags
specially allotted to him, of whom he was supposed to be the guide,
philosopher, and friend, and who in return for these good offices had
to clean out his study every morning by turns, directly after first
lesson and before he returned from breakfast.</p>

<p class='c012'>1857. <span class='sc'>G. A. Lawrence</span>, <i>Guy Livingstone</i>, ch. i. Is still enumerated
among the feats of the brave days of old, by the <span class='fss'>FAGS</span> over their evening
small beer.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Christ’s Hospital).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1850. <span class='sc'>L. Hunt</span>, <i>Autobiography</i>, ch. iii. <span class='sc'>Fag</span>, with us [at Christ’s
Hospital] meant eatables. The learned derived the word from the
Greek <i>phago</i>, to eat.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. (Stonyhurst).—A fielder: at cricket. Also
<span class='fss'>FAGGER</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. (Stonyhurst).—A bore.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb.</i> 1. (general).—To do menial work for a schoolfellow
in a higher Form. Hence <span class='fss'>FAGGER</span>, <span class='fss'>FAG-MASTER</span>,
<span class='fss'>FAGGING</span>, and <span class='fss'>FAGGERY</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>De Quincey</span>, <i>Autob. Sketches</i>, i. 210. <span class='sc'>Faggery</span> was an abuse
too venerable and sacred to be touched by profane hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>1873. <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 17th May. The Winchester “tunding”
system, with all its faults, is hardly less objectionable than the <span class='fss'>FAGGING</span>
system pursued in the Scotch endowed hospitals.</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <i>Felstedian</i>, Nov., p. 75. As I was smaller and weaker than
most of the <span class='fss'>FAGS</span> running, I hardly ever managed to get a place, and
it was absurd to expect me to do so. I had been “spanked” two or
three times already for failing, but I don’t know that I was more successful
for that. I know I cordially detested that branch of <span class='fss'>FAGGING</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1884. <i>Temple Bar</i>, August, p. 514. He must have completely marred
his chance of happiness at the school when he refused to <span class='fss'>FAG</span> and took
countless thrashings, snivelling.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i>, 46. My new <span class='fss'>FAG-MASTER</span>,
Forker Major, is a beast.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Stonyhurst).—To field: at cricket. The
ordinary meaning either as <i>subs.</i> or <i>verb</i> does not
exist at Stonyhurst.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Fag-book</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—Formerly a book
given by a monitor on leaving to each of his fags:
it is now usual to give a bat or a racket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Fain lo!</b> (or <b>Loss</b>), <i>intj.</i> (Felsted).—A phrase used to
retain a seat, &amp;c., temporarily vacated. Also <span class='sc'>Lo</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Fains</b> (<b>Fainits!</b> or <b>Fain it</b>), <i>intj.</i> (general).—A call for
truce during the progress of a game without which
priority of place would be lost; generally understood
to be demanded “in bounds,” or when out of
danger. [Thought to be a corruption of “fend.”]</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (also <span class='sc'>Fend</span>, <span class='sc'>Fain</span>, <span class='sc'>Fainits</span>, &amp;c.).—A cry of
warning, or of prohibition: as to prevent any change
in the existing conditions of a game; <i>e.g.</i> at marbles,
<span class='fss'>FEN-PLACINGS</span> = no alteration in position of marbles
is permissible; <span class='fss'>FEN-CLEARANCES</span> = removal of obstacles
is forbidden. [<span class='sc'>Fend</span> = <i>M.E. defend</i> in sense
of “to forbid.”] <span class='sc'>Fain</span>, and <span class='sc'>fain I</span>, are corruptions.
At Winchester, <span class='fss'>FINGY YOU</span>, or <span class='fss'>FINGY THAT</span>, are
analagous; but at Christ’s Hospital <span class='fss'>FIN</span> = “I won’t
have.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Ante</i> 1815. <span class='sc'>E. C. Harrington</span>, in <i>N. and Q.</i>, 5 S., vii. 98. Respecting
the word <span class='fss'>FEN</span> ... I can testify to the use of the term by school-boys
prior to the battle of Waterloo ... meaning that we protested
against an exceptional action.</p>

<p class='c012'>1852. <span class='sc'>Dickens</span>, <i>Bleak House</i>. “I’m fly,” says Jo. “But <span class='fss'>FEN</span> larks,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1877. <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5 S., vii. 178. A comical application was, I
remember well, “<span class='fss'>FEN</span> live lumber!” which, if pronounced in time,
would disable your opponent from moving a bystander out of the way
of his shot.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Fardel</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A division of

<p class='c010'><b>Faside</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Loretto).—To Faside Castle, and back:
altogether about five miles. Boys who have been
watching football matches have always to do this
in wet weather; and, in bad weather, a <span class='sc'>Wallyford</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>). Whence <span class='sc'>Faside and Three Trees</span> = a combined

to <span class='fss'>FOUNDER’S-KIN</span> in the election soon brought into the field, as may
be supposed, young Wykehams and Williamses from all quarters, with
others who proved more or less satisfactorily their connection with
the founder’s family; and gradually the customs obtained of electing
two only of these favoured candidates at the head of the roll for
admission, and filling up the remaining vacancies by a process of successive
nominations by each of the six electors, the Warden of New
College having the first turn, until the number of vacancies was
supplied.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, p. 166. Since the glories of Montem have departed,
the <span class='sc'>fourth of June procession</span> has taken its place as the great
yearly festival of Etonians. It was instituted in commemoration of a
visit of King George III., and is held on his birthday. It is the great
trysting day of Eton, when her sons gather from far and wide, young
and old, great and small,—no matter who or what, so long as they are
old Etonians; that magic bond binds them all together as brothers,
and levels for the time all distinctions of age or rank. The proceedings
begin with the ‘speeches’ delivered in the upper school at twelve
o’clock before the provost, fellows, masters, and a large audience of
the boys’ friends. Selections from classical authors, ancient or modern,
are recited by the Sixth-form boys, who are dressed for the occasion
in black swallow-tail coats, white ties, black knee-breeches and buckles,
silk stockings, and pumps. Then follows the provost’s luncheon, given
in the college hall to the distinguished visitors, while similar entertainments
on a smaller scale are going on in the various tutors’ and
dames’ houses. At 3 o’clock there is full choral service in chapel. At
6 o’clock all hands adjourn to the Brocas, a large open meadow, to
witness the great event of the day,—the procession of the Boats to
Surly Hall, a public-house of that name, on the right bank of the river,
some three and a half miles from Windsor. The boats are divided
into two classes—Upper and Lower. The Upper division consists of
the <i>Monarch</i> ten-oar, the <i>Victory</i>, and the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, or, as it is
more usually called, the <i>Third Upper</i>. The Lower boats are the
<i>Britannia</i>, <i>Dreadnought</i>, <i>Thetis</i>, and <i>St. George</i>; sometimes, when the
number of aspirants to a place is larger than usual, an eighth boat
called the <i>Defiance</i> is added. The collegers have also for some years
put on a four-oar—latterly expanded into an eight—which follows in
the procession. The flotilla is preceded by the Eton racing eight-oar,
manned by the picked crew who are to contend at Putney or Henley.
Each boat has its distinctive uniform. Formerly these were very
fanciful—Greek pirates, or galley slaves in silver chains, astonishing
the quiet reaches of the Thames for the day. The crews of the Upper
boats now wear dark blue jackets and trousers, and straw hats with
ribbons, displaying the name of the boat in gold letters. The coxswains
are dressed in an admiral’s uniform, with gold fittings, sword, and
cocked-hat. The captain of each boat has an anchor and crown embroidered
in gold on the left sleeve of his jacket. In the Lower boats,
the crews wear trousers of white jean, and all ornaments and embroidery
are in silver. Each boat carries a large silk flag in the stern. The
procession is headed by a quaint old-fashioned boat (an Eton racing
boat of primitive days) rowed by watermen and conveying a military
band. The Westminster eight always receives an invitation to this
celebration, and occasionally makes its appearance on the river, adding
very much to the interest of the procession.... Opposite to Surly
Hall, a liberal display of good things ... awaits the arrival of the
crews—the Sixth Form alone being accommodated with a tent. After
a few toasts, and as much champagne as can be fairly disposed of in
a short time, the captain of the boat gives the word for all to re-embark,
and the flotilla returns to Eton in the same order.... Singing,
shouting, racing, and bumping, all go on together in the most harmonious
confusion.... The boats, after their return through Windsor
Bridge, turn and row two or three times round an eyot in the middle
of the stream above the bridge. During this time a grand display of
fireworks takes place on the eyot. The ringing of the fine old bells in
the Curfew Tower, the cheering of the crews, and the brilliant coloured
fires which strike across the water, and light up the dense masses of
spectators along the bridge, the rafts, and the shore, produce an effect
not easily forgotten. A pyrotechnic illumination of the College arms
concludes the ceremonies, and is the signal for the crews to land and
march in jubilant disorder back to College.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Fresh-herring</b>, <i>subs.</i> (King Edward’s, Birm.).—A boy
newly admitted to the school. Such a one is seized
on his first or first few visits to the playground, and
conveyed to a corner—a <span class='fss'>MONKEY DEN</span>—where he is
more or less forcibly <span class='fss'>SQUABBED</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) against the
wall by as many persecutors as can get at him.
The incongruity of fresh-herrings in a monkey-den
does not seem to be remarked. But twenty-five to
thirty years ago <span class='fss'>FRESH-HERRINGS</span> were hurled over
<i>the Precipice</i>. This was a drop of some six or eight
feet from the general level of the playground over a
retaining wall to the bottom of an incline up which
coal-stores, &amp;c., could be brought into the playground.
The new science and art rooms have
covered the site, and <span class='fss'>MONKEY-DEN</span> has superseded
the terrors of this local Tarpeian Rock. The <span class='fss'>FRESH-HERRING</span>
is always told that he must bring beeswax

this or some other form of furniture-polish, to the

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 138. Midway
between each of the two ends of the line was stationed another boy, as

scored three for the party that kicked it.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>God</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Eton).—A Sixth Form boy. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

used to look after the “<span class='fss'>GREENS</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Greeze</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Westminster).—A crowd.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Greyers</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Grey flannel trousers: worn by

<p class='c012'>1889. <span class='sc'>Whibley</span>, <i>Cap and Gown</i>, xxviii. The members of Clare ...
were called <span class='fss'>GRAYHOUNDS</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grind</b>, <i>subs.</i> (common).—(1) Study; reading for an

student. (3) Athletic sports in general: specifically,
a training run. Also as <i>verb</i> = to teach; to instruct;
to coach.</p>

<p class='c012'>1856. <span class='sc'>Hughes</span>, <i>Tom Brown’s School-days</i>, pt. <span class='fss'>II.</span> ch. v. “Come

it. <i>Ibid.</i>, ch. vii. “The thing to find out,” said Tom meditatively,
“is how long one ought to <span class='fss'>GRIND</span> at a sentence without looking at
the crib.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1872. <i>Chambers’s Jour.</i>, April. Joe Rullock, the mighty gymnasiarch,
the hero of a hundred <span class='fss'>GRINDS</span>, the unwearied haunter of the palæstra,
could never give the lie to his whole past life, and deny his own
gymnastics.</p>

<p class='c012'>1887. <i>Chambers’s Jour.</i>, 14th May, p. 310. Smalls made just such a
goal as was required, and the <span class='fss'>GRIND</span> it entailed was frequently of no
slight profit to him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Grind</span>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—The ferry-boat
at Chesterton. (Oxford) A diversion popular among
the less athletic tutors and undergraduates, which
consists in walking by the Banbury Road to the 2-1/2
mile stone, crossing to the Woodstock Road, which
is here only a quarter of a mile distant, and so
returning to Oxford, occasionally varying the proceeding
by reversing the order of the walk. It is,
however, probable that the introduction of golf
has dealt a severe blow at the popularity of this
innocent amusement. Also <span class='fss'>THE FIVE MILES GRIND</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>’Varsity Grind</span> (Oxford).—A steeplechase held
at Stratton Audley.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grind-days</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Loretto).—The <span class='fss'>GRIND-DAYS</span> occur
twice a year: in October and March. Privileged
boys, school officers, Sixth and Fifth, and probably
Upper Fifth, go by train to various places, such as
Peebles, Pomathorn, &amp;c., and walk, perhaps about
twenty miles, to some other place, where they
dine, returning by train. Some of the rest cross
the Pentlands, and the Juniors go up the highest
Pentland.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grinder</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—A private tutor; a <span class='fss'>COACH</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

examination.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Groats.</b> <span class='sc'>To save one’s groats</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (old University).—To

nine groats are deposited in the hands of an

are returned to him.—<span class='sc'>Grose.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grotius-time</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—From 7 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> to 7.45

<p class='c010'><b>Groute</b>, <i>verb</i> (Marlborough and Cheltenham).—To work
or study hard; to <span class='fss'>SWOT</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <i>Public School Mag.</i>, Dec., p. 441. The shop is privately managed
by Mr. Kimmins, of High Street, Tonbridge [and] is known as
“<span class='fss'>GRUBBER</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grubby</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.).—The luncheon
room.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gruff</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—Low-pitched: of the

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1844. <i>Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital</i> [<i>The Blue</i>, Aug. 1874]. The
voices, in our own peculiar phraseology, being divided into two classes—those
who sang “squeaky,” and those who sang <span class='fss'>GRUFF</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Guarder</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A goal-keeper: at football.
Whence <span class='fss'>SECOND-GUARDER</span> = the “full-back” of Association
Football; and <span class='fss'>THIRD-GUARDER</span> = the “halfback”
of Association Football.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gulf</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—The bottom of a list of
“passes,” with the names of those who only just
succeed in getting their degree. At Oxford a
man who, going in for honours, only gets a pass.
Hence as <i>verb</i> (Cambridge) = to place in the
<span class='fss'>GULF</span>; <span class='fss'>TO BE GULFED</span> = to be on such a list.
[Men so placed were not eligible for the Classical
Tripos.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1852. <span class='sc'>Bristed</span>, <i>Five Tears in an English University</i>, p. 205. Some
ten or fifteen men just on the line, not bad enough to be plucked, or
good enough to be placed, are put into the <span class='fss'>GULF</span>, as it is popularly
called (the examiners’ phrase is “degrees allowed”), and have their
degrees given them, but are not printed in the calendar. <i>Ibid.</i>, 297.

scolded, predicted that they would all be either <span class='fss'>GULFED</span>
or ploughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Sporting Gaz.</i>, April 1. A man who was <i>GULFED</i> for mathematical
honours was certainly, in olden time, unable to enter for the
classical examination; but though the arrangement is altered, the term
is <i>not</i> obsolete. A man who is <span class='fss'>GULFED</span> is considered to know enough
mathematics for an ordinary degree, but not enough to be allowed his
degree in mathematics only; he is consequently obliged to pass in all
the ordinary subjects (except mathematics) for the “poll,” before
taking his degree.</p>

<p class='c012'>1876. <span class='sc'>Trevelyan</span>, <span class='sc'>Life of Macaulay</span> (1884), ch. ii. p. 61. When

<p class='c010'><b>Gull</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Oxford: obsolete).—A swindler; a trickster.
<i>Cf.</i> “<span class='sc'>Gull-catcher</span>,” of which it is probably an abbreviation.</p>

<p class='c012'>1825. <i>The English Spy</i>, v. i. p. 161. “You’ll excuse me, sir, but as
you are <i>fresh</i>, take care to avoid the <span class='fss'>GULLS</span>.” “I never understood
that <span class='fss'>GULLS</span> were birds of prey,” said I. “Only in Oxford, sir, and
here, I assure you, they bite like hawks.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gutter</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Tonbridge).—A scrummage at Rugby football:
now nearly obsolete. [Properly the space
between the teams in the scrummage.]</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (Winchester).—To fall in the water flat on
the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gymmy</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Manchester Grammar).—The gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gyp</b> (or <b>Gip</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—A college servant.
At Oxford, a scout; at Dublin, a skip. [Etymology
doubtful: according to <i>Sat. Rev.</i> an abbreviation of
Gipsy Joe: according to Cambridge undergraduates,
from the Greek γυψ (<span class='fss'>GUPS</span>) = a vulture; from the
creature’s rapacity.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1794. <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, p. 1085. [A Cambridge college servant is called
a <span class='fss'>JIP</span>.]</p>

his <span class='fss'>GYP</span> well.</p>

<p class='c012'>1842. <i>Tait’s Mag.</i>, Oct., “Reminiscences of Coll. Life.” There is
attached to colleges and halls a person more useful than ornamental,
and better known than paid, whom Oxonians name <span class='fss'>GYP</span>, from his supposed
moral affinity to a vulture (γυψ). The same is in Dublin denominated
a <i>Skip</i>, because of the activity which is an indispensable item
in his qualifications.</p>

<p class='c012'>1849. <span class='sc'>C. Kingsley</span>, <i>Alton Locke</i>, ch. xii. I’ll send you in luncheon
as I go through the butteries; then, perhaps, you’d like to come down

boys in the early years of the century turned into
a debating-place, to promote the views of O’Connell
and his party. [A corruption of ἁγορά.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <i>Felstedian</i>, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” At
6.15, when the first bell for chapel rings, I go round and wake up
everybody; as the præfects like hot water for washing, I make up a
fire, and put on the boilers; in other words, throw a bundle of sticks
called a “<span class='fss'>HALF-FAGGOT</span>” on the old-fashioned “dogs,” or uprights,
which form the only fireplaces in chambers, coal not being in use.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hall</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Oxford).—Dinner. Also as <i>verb</i> = to dine.
[Taken in College Hall.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i>, 55. A lot of Freshmen got

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>To go on hall</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester).—To

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 48. However, as boys came
to school better scholars, and were consequently higher placed, fourth
form fags grew scarce, and the junior fifth were ordered, as the phrase
was, <span class='fss'>TO GO ON HALL</span>. One champion stood upon his rights, and refused;
the indignant prefect proposed to thrash him publicly; the
juniors rose in a body and pinioned the prefects. Fond mammas, and
other declaimers against school tyranny, will regret to hear that this
spirited resistance was not appreciated by Dr. Williams; after a patient
hearing of the pleas on both sides, he supported the prefect’s authority
(it may be concluded that they had not really exceeded it), and six
of the ringleaders were expelled.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hall-crier</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Shrewsbury).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 249. And two <span class='fss'>HALL-CRIERS</span>
(or latterly one), whose chief business was to read out at breakfast
time lists of the fags on duty for cricket or football, descriptions of
lost articles, &amp;c. &amp;c. This office in former days had commonly to be
performed under a fire of such missiles as came handiest—amongst
them often the regulation iron spoons supplied for the bread-and-milk
breakfast which was the fare in the rougher days of Shrewsbury.
Each proclamation began in due form with “Oh yes! oh yes! (Oyez!
oyez!)” and ended with “God save the King (or Queen)! and d——
the Radicals!”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hall-fagging</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A duty imposed
on sixteen of the lowest boys in each House. They
have to attend in Hall, usually four at a time, and
carry out orders, while the monitors have breakfast
and tea. There was no need for this duty at Old
Charterhouse, fags being always at hand. At New
Charterhouse this was not always the case; they
were often playing at football or cricket, or sitting in
the library. Monitors, therefore, arranged the system
of <span class='fss'>HALL-FAGGING</span>. Latterly it has become usual to
send into Hall fags who have offended against
monitorial discipline, have been talkative in <span class='sc'>Banco</span>,
or noisy in the cubicles. Where such culprits are
available the regular fags are exempt.—<span class='sc'>Tod.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Halve</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A half-holiday: on Wednesdays
and Saturdays.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Halves</b> (pron. <i>Hāves</i>), <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—Half-Wellington
boots, which were strictly <i>Non

<p class='c010'><b>Handball</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—(1) The Stonyhurst form
of Fives. Also (2) the ball used in playing; (3) the
wall against which the game is played; and (4) the
courts into which the wall and ground are divided.</p>

<p class='c012'>1887. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, iii. 18, “Stonyhurst in the Fifties.” On
Whit-Saturday <span class='fss'>HANDBALL</span> came in. We had on that morning 2-1/2 hours’
school ... and having gone up to the study-place to put away our
books were let out by schools to run for places. In the old playground
there stood one of the present <span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span>, one side of it belonging to
the Higher Line, and one to the Lower. Of the Higher Line <span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span>
[on each side of this <span class='fss'>HANDBALL</span>—the wall—were two <span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span>
or courts] one belonged to Rhetoric and one to Poetry. Of the
Lower Line <span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span> one to Grammar and one to Rudiments.
There were besides in both Higher and Lower Lines, other inferior
<span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span> in the wall which separated the playground from the
garden, where the rails now stand. They were called “The Pavilions,”
and each contained three courts. Those in the Higher Line were
common property, the Lower Line ones belonged to Rudiments,
Figures, and Elements. Syntax had thus no <span class='fss'>HANDBALL</span> and Rudiments
had two. In the Higher Line possession of the <span class='fss'>HANDBALL</span>
always went to the first comers, those who first “touched-in” having
it. In the Lower Line during after-dinner recreation (at least in the
large <span class='fss'>HANDBALLS</span>) it went by order of Compositions.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Handing-up</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A form of Lynch law
inflicted [up to the second quarter of the century]
by monitors on a boy known to have been guilty of
any highly disgraceful conduct reflecting on the
character of the school—stealing, for example. The
monitors satisfied themselves, after careful inquiry,
of the guilt of the accused, and called him before
an assembly of the Upper School in Butler’s Hall,
where he received from each monitor a certain
number of blows with a study toasting-fork. The
punishment was severe, but merciful to the delinquent
as an alternative in some cases to expulsion
if the charge had been brought before the
head-master.—<span class='sc'>Thornton.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Harder</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Racquets: as opposed to
<span class='sc'>Squash</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); also a racquet ball. Whence <span class='fss'>HARDER-COURT</span>
= the racquet court.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hard-up</b>, <i>adv.</i> (Winchester).—Abashed or out of countenance;
exhausted (as in swimming).</p>

to be either a person, four-and-twenty years of age, and of an infirm
state of health, who is permitted to dine with the Fellows, and to wear
a plain, black, full-sleeved gown; or else he is one who, having kept
all the terms, by statute required previous to his law-act, is <i>hoc ipsa

bachelor, by courtesy.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hatch</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A flood-gate. [Hatch = a

wicket-gate, or half-door.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hatch-thoke</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A Founder’s Commemoration-day.

occasions, names being called at <span class='fss'>HATCH</span> in Commoners.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Haul</b>, <i>verb</i> (University).—To summon before the Proctor
for misdemeanour. Whence <span class='fss'>HAULABLE</span>, <i>adj.</i>, used
of those whose society authorities deem undesirable
for the men: <i>e.g.</i> they’re <span class='fss'>HAULABLE</span> = those caught
with them will be proctorised.</p>

who during life had lain in wait for monied comrades, assailing them
with importunate entreaties or even with open violence. Now they
outstretched bony hands in vain for juicy “<span class='fss'>HIGHS</span>,” which mocked and

Catherine’s Hill, a green hill about one mile and a half from College,
about five hundred feet high, and near the top surrounded by a deep
trench, the remains of an old Roman camp. The boys had to ascend
this twice a day on whole Holidays and Remedies, once before breakfast,
and again at half-past two. In the summer they also went out in
the evening, but did not ascend Hills, but disported themselves below.
These sorties were called “going on to <span class='fss'>HILLS</span>,” the evening expedition
being called “Underhills.” <i>Ibid.</i>, iii. Ordinary offences of a

once in the morning, returning at nine to breakfast, and again in the

Old Charterhouse. The bats were huge bludgeons
called hockey-sticks, but without any curve at the
end; the balls were like large fives-balls, and a
little smaller than a regulation cricket-ball; the
wickets were usually coats or jackets; gownboy
jackets were much the best, because they were stiff
and easily stood upright; the pitch was either on
the football ground, where there was no grass, or
on a flagged pavement in cloisters.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1800-29. <i>The Blue-Coat Boy</i> [<i>More Gleanings from</i>

“Hedgehogs.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Jack-o’-Lantern</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton and Harrow: obsolete).—A
nocturnal form of “Hare and Hounds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 312. But there was an ancient
form of it [“Hare and Hounds”] at Harrow, so especially attractive
as being pursued at unlawful hours and under unusual difficulties, that
it deserves special mention. It was known also in former days at
Eton, and in both schools went by the name of <span class='fss'>JACK O’ LANTERN</span>.
About seven o’clock on winter evenings, when it was quite dark, the
boys, by sufferance on the part of the authorities, were let out from
their several boarding-houses into the fields below the school. A stout
and active runner started in advance, carrying a lantern, by the light
of which the rest pursued him in full cry. He showed or concealed
his light from time to time, and a great point of the sport was to
entice the hounds into some pool or muddy ditch (which “Jack”
himself has carefully avoided) by showing the light exactly in a line
on the other side.</p>

<p class='c012'>1885. <span class='sc'>Thornton</span>, <i>Harrow School</i>, p. 276. <span class='sc'>Jack-o’-lantern</span> was
abolished by Dr. George Butler, but re-appeared in Dr. Longley’s time
as one of those forbidden pleasures so dear to youth. Always played
in the evening, and originally by sufferance of the authorities, the
game in question was simply a run across country after a lantern
carried by a swift-footed boy. Oftentimes would the luckless hounds
be enticed into some slough of despond, and the performers return in
a condition of mud which may find its equal on a wet football day or
a paper-chase forty years later, but yet present no adequate idea of
the confusion caused by the return from <span class='fss'>JACK-O’-LANTERN</span>, of thirty
or forty boys at night when in ordinary clothes. It is one of the most
distinct evidences that no discipline existed when we read of such a
proscribed saturnalia having occurred after lock-up in Dr. Longley’s
time. But the fact has been communicated to us by Harrow men
whose word is indisputable.</p>

masters were forbidden to take any fees (even from oppidans) was
probably evaded, almost from the first, by the system then universal
in all transactions of giving presents, under which heading the sons of
wealthy parents soon began to pay pretty highly for their education.
Traces of this arrangement remain in the custom still prevailing—not
at all to the credit of the school—of presenting a sum as <span class='fss'>LEAVING-MONEY</span>
to the head-master and the private tutor. At what time

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, 80. On Shrove-Tuesday, according to a
custom dating from 1850 or probably earlier, every boy used to receive
half a lemon with his pancake at dinner. This he reserved to use as a
missile in the fight which was to take place directly afterwards. At
Old Charterhouse, gownboys used to stand against the rest of the
school, and the fight consisted in each side pelting the other with the
half lemons. It lasted for fifteen or twenty minutes, and was begun
and ended by a house bell being rung. During these twenty minutes
a good many bruises and black eyes could be received, for combatants
fought at quite close quarters; and unpopular monitors were sometimes
badly damaged. At New Charterhouse the sides were at first
Old Charterhouse <i>v.</i> New. In 1877 they were changed again to
Out-houses <i>v.</i> The Rest. This was the last fight. Grave abuses had
crept in. The lemons were no longer simple lemons, but a sort of
bomb-shell, loaded with pebbles or ink, and several boys were badly
hurt. So the Sixth Form in 1878 “totally abolished <span class='fss'>LEMON PEEL</span> as
a barbarous and obsolete practice.” It required a strong Sixth Form
to do this, for the fight was popular, and their action is one of the
best things that the school has done for itself. Its abolition differs
from the abolition of fighting; the latter became obsolete through
the action of public opinion; <span class='fss'>LEMON PEEL</span> was abolished by an ukase
almost in defiance of public opinion.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 14. To Francis Hodgson, who was

condition of the scholars, or collegers, which was effected in the

containing no less than fifty-two beds, notorious for its filth and
discomfort, was considerably curtailed, and separate rooms were
provided for forty-nine boys by the erection of a new wing.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <b>Brinsley Richards</b>, <i>Seven Years at Eton</i>, 321. A glass
nearly a yard long, shaped like the horn of a stage-coach guard, and
with a hollow globe instead of a foot. It held a quart of beer, and the
ceremony of drinking out of it constituted an initiation into the higher
circle of Etonian swelldom. There was <span class='fss'>LONG-GLASS</span> drinking once or
twice a week during the summer half. The <i>invités</i> attended in an
upper room of Tap after two, and each before the long glass was
handed to him had a napkin tied round his neck. It was considered
a grand thing to drain the glass without removing it from the lips,
and without spilling any of its contents. This was difficult, because
when the contents of the tubular portion of the glass had been sucked
down, the beer in the globe would remain for a moment as if congealed
there: then if the drinker tilted the glass up a little, and shook
it, the motionless beer would give a gurgle and come with a sudden
rush all over his face. There was a way of holding the long glass at a
certain angle by which catastrophes were avoided. Some boys could
toss off their quart of ale in quite superior style, and I may as well
remark that these clever fellows could do little else.</p>

<p class='c012'>1864. <i>The Press</i>, Nov. 12. By the way, we miss the Etonian word

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 21. Like Wykeham’s scholars, the Eton boys rose
[<i>temp.</i> Eliz.] at five, said their Latin prayers antiphonally while
dressing, then made their own beds and swept out their chambers.
Two by two they then “went down” to wash, probably at some
outdoor conduit or fountain like the old Winchester <span class='fss'>MOAB</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 45. Independent of very
early hours and somewhat coarse fare, it was not pleasant to have

which consisted in the scholars going in procession
on the Whit-Tuesday of every third year to a
mound (Lat. <i>ad montem</i>) near the Bath Road, and
exacting a gratuity from persons present or passing
by. The collection was given to the captain or
senior scholar, and helped to defray his expenses at
the University. <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Salt</span>, and <i>Sloane MS.</i> 4839, f. 85.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <span class='sc'>Brewer</span>, <i>Phrase and Fable</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Salt-hill</span>. The mound at
Eton [near the Bath Road], where the Eton scholars used to collect
money from the visitors on Montem day. The mound is still called
<i>Salt Hill</i>, and the money given was called <i>salt</i>. The word salt is
similar to the Latin <i>sala’rium</i> (salary), the pay given to Roman soldiers

himself with a <span class='fss'>MORTAR</span> or college-cap.</p>

<p class='c012'>1898. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” The wearing
of a cap and gown is another novelty for freshmen. At first one is
apt to feel very foolish under a “<span class='fss'>MORTAR-BOARD</span>” and in the folds of
the academic gown, particularly in the miserable garb assigned to
commoners (<i>i.e.</i> undergraduates without scholarships).</p>

received a Scrubbing. When the words to the Bible-clerk were added,
the business was confided to that officer, who, with the Ostiarius,
officiated at the subsequent ceremony, which in this case was called a

revival of one that prevailed in ancient times, is
under the control of a body termed the Delegacy,
the chief officer being named the Censor. Efficient
provision is made for tuition, but its members live
in their own lodgings in the city, and are thus able

<p class='c012'>1840. <i>The Collegian’s Guide</i>, 119. In college each set
of rooms is provided with an <span class='fss'>OAK</span> or outer door, with a
spring lock, of which the master has one key, and the servant another.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span> (“Cuthbert Bede”), <i>Verdant Green</i>, iv. This is
the <span class='fss'>HOAK</span>, this ’ere outer door is, sir, which the gentlemen sports, that

<p class='c012'>1861. <span class='sc'>Hughes</span>, <i>Tom Brown at Oxford</i>, vii. One evening he found
himself as usual at Hardy’s door about eight o’clock. The <span class='fss'>OAK</span> was
open, but he got no answer when he knocked at the inner door.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i>, 55. He tried to keep them out,
but they broke in his <span class='fss'>OAK</span>, stripped him, tied him up in his table-cloth,
and left him on the grass plot where the porter found him.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>On-and-Off</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Tonbridge).—Lemonade.</p>

<p class='c012'>1894. <i>Tonbridgian</i>, No. 330, 919. The scene is one of the wildest
disorder. The writhing mass, in their efforts to obtain the desired
article, tread on each other’s toes, spill the “<span class='fss'>OFF AND ON</span>” down one
another’s garments, and knock each other about with their elbows.</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <i>Public School Mag.</i>, Dec., p. 444. “<span class='sc'>On and off</span>” signifies home
lemonade, and is so called because of the tap from which it flows.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ones</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—A competition at football, one
player a side: organised by Mr. Bowen. The play
is for five minutes, the ground measures 40 yards

<p class='c010'><b>Oppidan</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—A boy who boards in the town,
as distinguished from a King’s Scholar.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 31. The Latin-English term <span class='fss'>OPPIDAN</span> was applied
to these independent scholars at least as early as Fuller’s days. Speaking
of the College, he says, “There be many <span class='fss'>OPPIDANES</span> there maintained
at the cost of their friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <i>Public School Mag.</i>, Nov., p. 367. If there is any need for a
test match between college and the <span class='fss'>OPPIDANS</span>, we should suggest that
they should play the winning house in the House match, and hope to
beat it.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Optime</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—The name given to the
second class in the first portion of the public
examination for honours, called the Mathematical

as Junior Optimes.</p>

promise to add a day or two to the holidays: sometimes
obtained, so tradition says, by barricading
Big School against him.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ostiar</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Sherborne: obsolete).—The Præfect on
duty at the Big School door: seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i>, 223. <span class='sc'>Ostiarius</span>, an
office held by the Præfects in succession. The duties were, to keep
order in school, collect the Vulguses, and prevent the boys from
shirking out. It is also the official title for the Second Master.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 133. A peculiarity in the arrangements at Eton is,
that the school is practically divided into two. The division seems to
have been in force from the very earliest times—the three lower forms
having been then, as now, under the charge of the <span class='fss'>OSTIARIUS</span>, or, as he
is now called, the lower master, who has the appointment of his own
provost-assistants, and is practically independent of the head-master,
and subject only to the control of the provost.</p>

<p class='c012'>1866. <i>Wykehamist</i>, No. 1, Oct. We know of nothing more which
calls for notice, except the revival by Dr. Moberly of the <span class='fss'>OSTIARIUS</span>—an
office which had been discontinued for many years, but was revived
by the Head-master on account of the great increase in the number of
the school.</p>

<p class='c012'>1878. <span class='sc'>Adams</span>, <i>Wykehamica</i>, xxiii. 429. <span class='sc'>Ostiarius</span>, the Præfect in

<p class='c010'><b>Out-houses</b> (Charterhouse).—All the boarding-houses
except Sanderites, Verites, and Gownboys. The
names of the eight <span class='fss'>OUT-HOUSES</span> are Girdlestonites,
Lockites, Weekites, Hodgsonites, Bodeites, Daviesites,
Pageites, and Robinites (the last a contraction
of Robinsonites). Except Bodeites, each house
bears the name of its first master. One house,
Uskites—from a supposed similarity of the surroundings
to the valley of the Usk—disappeared
in 1878.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Out-match</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A match played against
a visiting team.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Over-school</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—A kind of common sitting-room
in the “new” building of 1755. The boys’
boxes were kept there, and <span class='sc'>Ash-planting</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) inflicted.
The present school-house hall was built
on the site.</p>

quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, 171. The old Shrove-Tuesday
custom of <span class='fss'>TOSSING THE PANCAKE</span>, though now peculiar to Westminster,
is said to have been also formerly in use at Eton. The
ceremony as at present performed is this. The cook, preceded by the
verger, enters the large school, in full official costume, with the hot
cake in the pan. He tosses it—or tries to toss it, for it is no easy feat—over
the iron bar, which has been already mentioned as having once
held a curtain screening off the upper school from the lower. If he
succeeds he claims a fee of two guineas. There is a scramble among
the boys, who stand on the other side of the bar, for the <span class='fss'>PANCAKE</span>,
and if any boy can secure it whole, which seldom happens, he carries it
up to the dean, who presents him with a sovereign. They also claim a
right to “book” the performer (<i>i.e.</i> hurl a shower of books at him)
if he fails more than once. This right was liberally exercised in 1865,
when the wrath of the school had culminated owing to repeated
failures in that and the previous year. The exasperated cook replied
to the attack with his only available missile—the frying-pan—and a
serious row was the consequence. The battle is celebrated in a clever
mock-heroic poem, in Greek Homeric verse, attributed to a high Westminster
authority.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pandie</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—A

(<i>q.v.</i>). [From the order given in Latin, <i>Pande

<p class='c010'><b>Passy</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—Severe: of a master.
[That is, “passionate.”—<span class='sc'>Blanch.</span>] <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

<p class='c012'>1844. <i>Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital</i> [<i>The Blue</i>, Aug. 1874]. Rightly
or wrongly, it was the general opinion in our time that punishment in
school depended less upon the correctness with which the lessons were
said, than upon the temper of the particular master. Frequently and
anxiously the question was asked, “Is he <span class='fss'>PASSY</span> this morning?” and
the arrival of a new master created immense excitement. Our first
queries were invariably of his manners and temper—matters of far
more importance to us than any question as to his ability.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Patrol</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Dulwich).—Keeping order in Form
rooms between morning and afternoon school: a
duty of school Præfects.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Paul’s-pigeons</b>, <i>subs.</i> (common).—The scholars of St.
Paul’s School.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pawmie</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—A
stroke on the hand from the leather strap known
as the <span class='fss'>TAWSE</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), used in Scotland instead of the

<p class='c010'><b>Pax</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A chum; an intimate friend.
[<i>Cf.</i> Scots <i>pack</i> = intimate, familiar.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Word-Book</i>, 30. Possibly the plural of “pack,”
which word has an extended use in reference to friendship ... as
<i>adj.</i>, <i>subs.</i>, and <i>verb</i>. This seems a more likely origin than the <span class='fss'>PAX</span> of
the Church.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Intj.</i> An injunction to desist or to silence—“Be

<p class='c010'><b>P. D.</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Dulwich).—Punishment drill: in Junior

<p class='c010'><b>Peal</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A custom in Commoners
of singing out comments on Præfects at

given on the last three Sundays of the Half for
articles of dress, &amp;c., connected with going home,
such as “Gomer Hats,” “Party Rolls,” &amp;c....
“The ringing of Chapel bells is also divided into
<span class='fss'>PEALS</span>.” [<span class='sc'>Halliwell.—Peals</span> = a noise or uproar.
<i>Cf.</i> Mid. Eng. <i>apel</i> = an old term in hunting music,
consisting of three long moots.]</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester College</i>, p. 62. The
junior in chamber had a hard time of it; ... while endeavouring to get
through his multifarious duties, he had to keep a sharp ear on the
performance of the chapel bell, and to call out accordingly, “first
<span class='fss'>PEAL!</span>” “second <i>PEAL</i>!” “bells down!”</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 22. The scholars at this time
were expected to rise at the sound of “first <span class='fss'>PEAL</span>” at five o’clock, and
were recommended to say privately a short Latin selection from the
Psalms as soon as they were dressed. <i>Ibid.</i> They then swept out their
chambers and made their beds (consisting in those days of nothing
better than bundles of straw with a coverlet), and <span class='fss'>SECOND PEAL</span> at
half-past five summoned them to chapel.</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <i>Felstedian</i>, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.”
At 6.30, I had to get back to call everybody again; and again at 6.40 (five
minutes to second <span class='fss'>PEAL</span>); at 6.45 (“second <span class='fss'>PEAL</span>”) when the chapel
bell started and kept on till seven. When the bell stops I wait at the
door and call out “præfect of chapel going in”—<i>i.e.</i> the præfect of
the week who calls names; then “præfect of chapel in” when he
reaches the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, Mar. 15, “Arnoldiana.”—He [Matthew
Arnold] was the victim of public expression of disapproval—in connection,
Mr. Arnold thinks, with the lively ceremony known as
<span class='fss'>CLOISTER PEALINGS</span>, when he was placed at the end of the great school,
and, amid howls and jeers, pelted with a rain of “pontos” for some
time. [<span class='sc'>Cloister</span> pealings is here incorrectly used: <i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Sticking-up</span>.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pec</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton: obsolete).—Money. [Lat. <i>pecunia</i>.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pempe</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—An imaginary object in

[From πεμπε μω̂ρον προτερον = “Send the fool
farther.”]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Penance-table</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A table in the refectory
at which a boy is condemned to sit alone
for bad behaviour during meals. Tradition says,
with some authority, that the present <span class='fss'>PENANCE-TABLE</span>
is the one on which Cromwell slept when
he spent a night at Stonyhurst. It is hence also
called “Cromwell’s Table.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Penance-walk</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A path in the playground
where malefactors are condemned to tramp
in silence during recreation time. The form of the
order given is: “Take an hour’s <span class='fss'>PENANCE</span>,” or “Go
on <span class='fss'>PENANCE</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pensioner</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—One who pays a “pensio”

horizontally against the name of an absentee.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 225. <span class='sc'>Percher</span>—A
mark (────┼──) put after a boy’s name on a Roll, which
showed that he had been absent from Chapel or Hills without leave;
or that he had not done his Verse or Prose Task, or Vulgus. It was
also often put by a Master in the margin of gags, or a Verse or Prose
Task, to indicate gross errors.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pets</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A set (says <span class='sc'>Tod</span>) of young
ruffians in Under Long Room whom the editor of
<i>The Verite Chronicle</i> (<i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Verite</span>) was constrained
from self-interest to place on the free list. Only
eight numbers appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Petties</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—According to the Founder’s

<p class='c012'>1798. “Christ’s Hospital Three Quarters of a Century Ago” [<i>Chelmsford

[Said to have been so used in the latter part of the
reign of Henry VIII.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1837. <span class='sc'>Ingram</span>, <i>Memorials of Oxford</i>.... The schools built by
Abbot Hokenorton being inadequate to the increasing wants of the
University, they applied to the Abbot of Reading for stone to rebuild
them; and in the year 1532 it appears that considerable sums of
money were expended on them; but they went to decay in the latter
part of the reign of Henry VIII. and during the whole reign of Edward
VI. The change of religion having occasioned a suspension of the
usual exercises and scholastic acts in the University, in the year 1540
only two of these schools were used by determiners, and within two
years after none at all. The whole area between these schools and
the divinity school was subsequently converted into a garden and <span class='fss'>PIG-MARKET</span>;
and the schools themselves, being completely abandoned by
the masters and scholars, were used by glovers and laundresses.</p>

abolished, amongst other old customs, certain rites and ceremonies
which were used in celebrating a boy’s remove from one form to the
other in the lower part of the school. No such promotion was considered
complete, so far as the boys were concerned, until the new
member had been duly “<span class='fss'>PINCHED IN</span>”—remaining a certain fixed
time in the play-room, during which all the fraternity exercised a
right of pinching him, limited only by the tenderness of their dispositions
or the strength of their fingers. There were generally some
adepts in this torture, who knew, and taught others, the tenderest
places and the most artistic mode of taking hold, and who carried
this evil knowledge with them from form to form, to be practised on
a succession of victims. The rites of initiation were completed by
tossing in a blanket in the dormitory, and a certain number of
bumps against the ceiling were required to make the ceremony
valid.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pintle</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Lancing).—(1) A form of cricket played
with a bat narrowed at both sides, a soft ball, and a

<p class='c010'><b>Pitch-up</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—One’s home circle; a

<p class='c012'>1881. <i>Felstedian</i>, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.”
My next duty is what is called “running for a <span class='fss'>PLACE</span>.” There are (or
were) six cricket pitches on “turf,” and any præfect has a right to one
of these all day (a bad arrangement, which I hope is altered now, as
fellows with no idea of cricket could thus keep much better players off
all day) provided he can get a stick with his name on, stuck in the
ground by his fag—the half-dozen out of the fifteen or twenty fags
running, who get their præfect’s sticks stuck in first, claiming the place
for him. It was the same sort of thing, as if the door from the
“underground” was opened about 6.30, and some twenty fellows
rushed out early in the morning to try and get pitches.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Plain-ruled</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—The paper usually used
for exercises, sixteen lines to a page.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Planks</b> (The), <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'>1856. <span class='sc'>Hughes</span>, <i>Tom Brown’s School-days</i>, viii. The river Avon at
Rugby is ... a capital river for bathing, as it has many nice small
pools and several good reaches for swimming, all within about a mile
of one another, and at an easy twenty minutes’ walk from the School.
This mile of water is rented, or used to be rented, for bathing purposes
by the Trustees of the School, for the boys. The footpath to
Brownsover crosses the river by <span class='fss'>THE PLANKS</span>, a curious old single-plank
bridge running for fifty or sixty yards into the flat meadows on
each side of the river—for in the winter there are frequent floods.
Above <span class='fss'>THE PLANKS</span> were the bathing-places for the smaller boys;
<span class='sc'>Sleath’s</span>, the first bathing-place, where all new boys had to begin,
until they had proved to the bathing men (three steady individuals,
who were paid to attend daily through the summer to prevent accidents)
that they could swim pretty decently, when they were allowed
to go on to <span class='sc'>Anstey’s</span>, about one hundred and fifty yards below. Here
there was a hole about six feet deep and twelve feet across, over which
the puffing urchins struggled to the opposite side, and thought no
small beer of themselves for having been out of their depths. Below
<span class='fss'>THE PLANKS</span> came larger and deeper holes, the first of which was
<span class='sc'>Wratislaw’s</span>, and the last <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span>, a famous hole, ten or twelve feet
deep in parts, and thirty yards across, from which there was a fine
swimming reach right down to the Mill. <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span> was reserved for
the sixth and fifth forms, and had a spring-board and two sets of
steps; the others had one set of steps each, and were used indifferently
by all the lower boys, though each house addicted itself more
to one hole than to another. The School-house at this time affected
<span class='sc'>Wratislaw’s</span> hole, and Tom and East, who had learnt to swim like
fishes, were to be found there as regular as the clock through the
summer, always twice, and often three times a day.</p>

... exercises ... from their excellence, were laid before the
provost, by a time-honoured custom, as a claim for the weekly half-holiday
called “<span class='fss'>PLAY</span>”—a ceremony which some other public schools

lend me;” “I’ll <span class='fss'>PLEDGE</span> it you when I’ve done

<p class='c012'>1882. <span class='sc'>Skeat</span> [<span class='sc'>Wrench</span>]. <span class='sc'>Skeat</span> says it comes from a Latin
<i>præbium</i>, connected with præbere, in which case <span class='fss'>PLEDGE</span> simply means
“give.”</p>

with the most dismal visions of <span class='fss'>PLUCKING</span>, and other college tortures.
<i>Ibid.</i>, xi. Note. When the degrees are conferred, the name of each
person is read out before he is presented to the Vice-Chancellor. The
proctor then walks once up and down the room, so that any person
who objects to the degree being granted may signify the same by
pulling or <span class='fss'>PLUCKING</span> the proctor’s robes. This has been occasionally
done by tradesmen, in order to obtain payment of their “little bills,”
but such a proceeding is very rare, and the proctor’s promenade is
usually undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c012'>1895. <i>Felstedian</i>, April, p. 44. We won the game by one goal, three
rouges—points to its origin. “<span class='sc'>Pog</span>” may have meant a “melancholy”
face originally, and in time come to denote any Felstedian’s
visage, grave or gay.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span> (“Cuthbert Bede”), <i>Verdant Green</i>, vii. A sort of
young procession—the Vice-Chancellor, with his and Yeoman-bedels.
The silver maces carried by the latter gentlemen, made them by far the
most showy part of the procession.... <i>Ibid.</i> Tom is the bell that
you hear at nine each night; the Vice has to see that he is in proper

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Cornhill Mag.</i>, Feb., 225. The heads of houses and university

<p class='c010'><b>Poll</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—The ordinary examination

that he was once so ill-advised as to desert a private tutor.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—To maltreat; to make

<p class='c010'><b>Ponto</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—New bread kneaded into a ball.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, Mar. 15, “Arnoldiana.” He [Matthew
Arnold] was placed at the end of the great school, and, amid howls
and jeers, pelted with a rain of <span class='fss'>PONTOS</span> for some time. The <span class='fss'>PONTO</span>,
though a soft missile, being but the inside of a new roll, was probably
sufficient in quantity.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pony</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—A translation; a <span class='fss'>CRIB</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)—any

the fleetness and ease with which a skilful rider is enabled to pass
over places which to a common plodder may present obstacles.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Poon</b>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To prop up a piece of furniture
with a wedge under the leg.—<span class='sc'>Wrench.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pop</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—A club at Eton. Chiefly confined
to <span class='sc'>Oppidans</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), though <span class='sc'>Collegers</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) are
sometimes elected.</p>

<p class='c012'>1865. <i>Etoniana</i>, 207. “The Eton Society,” for reading and debates,
has had a longer and more successful existence than the magazines.
It is better known by its sobriquet of “<span class='fss'>POP</span>,” supposed to be a contraction
of Popina, the rooms where it was held for many years having
been over a cookshop or confectioner’s. It was first instituted in 1811,
when Charles Fox Townshend (who was the elder brother of the late
Marquess, and died young) was the first president, and it has gone on
ever since with considerable popularity and success. The preparation
of the speeches leads to a certain amount of historical reading for the
purpose; but the chief attraction of “<span class='fss'>POP</span>” lies in its being a sort of
social club, where papers and reviews are taken in; and, as the numbers
are strictly limited (originally twenty-two, since increased to twenty-eight),
to be elected into the society gives a boy a certain degree of prestige
in the school. In summer the debates are almost nominal, out-door
attractions being too strong; but in winter they sometimes last for
several hours, and are kept up with great spirit. The members are
almost exclusively oppidans, this being one of the points where the
jealousy between them and the collegers comes out very distinctly. A
few of the latter are admitted, but only when they have some special
claim to popularity.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Portionist.</b> <i>See</i> Postmaster.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Poser</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester and Eton).—An examiner:

<p class='c012'>1855. <span class='sc'>Bristed</span>, <i>Eng. Univ.</i>, 74. Fifty marks will prevent one from
being <span class='fss'>POSTED</span>, but there are always two or three too stupid as well as
idle to save their <span class='fss'>POST</span>. These drones are <span class='fss'>POSTED</span> separately, as “not
worthy to be classed,” and privately slanged afterwards by the master
and seniors. Should a man be <span class='fss'>POSTED</span> twice in succession, he is
generally recommended to try the air of some small college, or devote
his energies to some other walk of life.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Verb.</i> 1. (University).—To reject: as in an examination;
to <span class='fss'>PLUCK</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); <span class='fss'>TO PLOUGH</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span> (“Cuthbert Bede”), <i>Verdant Green</i>, vii. Each
college does its own postal department; and at Merton there are
fourteen <span class='fss'>POSTMASTERS</span>, for they get no end of letters there. “Oh,
yes! I remember Mr. Larkyns ... telling us that the son of one of
his old friends had been a <span class='fss'>POSTMASTER</span> of Merton; but I fancied that
he had said it had something to do with a scholarship.” “Ah, you
see, it’s a long while since the governor was here, and his memory fails
him,” remarked Mr. Charles Larkyns, very unfilially.</p>

<p class='c012'>1886. <i>Oxford Guide</i> [S. J. &amp; C.]. The <span class='fss'>POSTMASTERS</span> anciently performed
the duties of choristers, and their payment for this duty was
six shillings and fourpence per annum.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Post-mortem</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—The examination

<p class='c012'>1882. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, i. 112. The dessert called <span class='fss'>POST-PAST</span> was
always the best sort of apples or pears, and biscuits, or else walnuts.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Post te</b>, <i>phr.</i> (Charterhouse).—The most useful (says
<span class='sc'>Tod</span>) of all the old Charterhouse expressions. For
example, <span class='fss'>POST TE MATH. EX.</span> = “Will you have the
kindness to permit me to glance over your mathematical
exercise?” Or one can give a <span class='fss'>POST TE</span> of
anything; <i>e.g.</i> to give a friend a <span class='fss'>POST TE</span> of a book
is to give him the right of its perusal when you
have done with it. The word is also used in a
subtle and sarcastic sense; <i>e.g.</i> <span class='fss'>POST TE</span> hat or
<span class='fss'>POST TE</span> chum signifies disapproval of the hat or
friend of which or whom the remark was made.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pot</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A canal lock. Whence <span class='fss'>POT-CAD</span>

<p class='c010'><b>Pot-house</b> (The), <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—St. Peter’s College:

eighteen Senior boys in College, and the twelve senior in
Commoners. The ten senior of those in College were said to be in
“Full power,” and took the office of Bible-Clerk in rotation; they all
had the power of fagging the Juniors, but those not in full power were
supposed not to have the right of fagging on the School side of Seventh
Chamber Passage; practically, however, they always did. One of the
Senior <span class='fss'>PRÆFECTS</span> was called <span class='fss'>PRÆFECT</span> of Hall, and was responsible in
a great measure for the conduct of the boys out of school. His duties
and privileges were numerous. There was also a “<span class='fss'>PRÆFECT</span> of Tub,”
who was supposed to see that the dinner was properly distributed; a
“<span class='fss'>PRÆFECT</span> of School,” who had the care of that building; and two
“<span class='fss'>PRÆFECTS</span> of Chapel,” who during alternate weeks called names in
Chapel. There were fees attached to all these offices; and all the
<span class='fss'>PRÆFECTS</span> had a certain number of boys allotted to them as Pupils,
each of whom paid one guinea each half.</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <i>Felstedian</i>, Nov., p. 75. Here let me observe that only the
<span class='fss'>PRÆFECTS</span> have separate basins to wash in; the juniors use the two
stone conduits.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Præfects</span>.... The
number of Præfects was eighteen in College, three to each Chamber
... in Commoners first eight, with four senior-inferiors, who were
like Præfects in half-power, and later twelve.... The word <span class='sc'>Præpostor</span>
was also used concurrently, it would appear, till the last century,
when it disappeared, except in the formula demanding a remedy,
in which it survives. What the relations of the two words were to
each other it is not easy to determine.... Præpostor occurs in the
College Register, and is still used in asking for Remedies. Both seem,
therefore, to be official words. At Eton Præpostor survives, though
they are stated to have begun with officers bearing other titles. They
have also retained <i>major</i>, <i>minor</i>, <i>minimus</i>, which we have discarded
for <i>senior</i>, <i>secundus</i>, <i>junior</i>. The “Præfect of Tub”—“qui nomen
ducit ab olla”—who presided over meals, and whose perquisites are
said to have been most lucrative—amounting to the value of £80 per

Prince and Princess Teck will grace one of the Lent <span class='fss'>PUBLIC SUPPERS</span>
with their distinguished presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, Mar. 16, “London Day by Day.” That quaint
and historic old custom known as the “public supping” of the children
was celebrated last evening at Christ’s Hospital, Newgate Street, in
the presence of the Lord Mayor, Alderman Vaughan Morgan (treasurer
of the school), and other civic and educational dignitaries.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 20th Mar., 3. 2, “A Lenten Supper.” Attention
is directed to this festival this year for two reasons—one, that it
is a very ancient custom; the other, that this is nearly the last year
in which it will be held; for it is clear that when the school has changed
its site, its dress, and certain of its officers and masters, it will not care
to carry on this quaint old ceremony. And indeed, were the Hospital
to hold such revelry at Horsham there would be few to come as guests,
if the name of guest can be assigned to one who plays a part so passive
as that of seeing other people eat.... The scene of the supping is
the Great Hall.... Six hundred boys and more appear as nothing;
they are all seated.... At each table sits a matron, according to their
wards (of which there are fifteen), and attached to each ward is a
matron, who used to be called nurse. Beside the tables are the monitors,
responsible for order—biggish boys—not “Grecians,” for Grecians
do not appear at the Lent suppers, except to read or pray or sing,
having already eaten in their wards. The first performance, probably,
is to light the candles on the tables; each ward has four candles, and
all are lighted at almost the same moment. The hall is lighted from
the roof by gas, so the candlesticks are little more than ornaments.
They are of oak, old, and well-weighted at the base, and can count
their age by centuries.... Their quaintness is concealed by artificial
flowers, which the boys pay for and the matrons arrange, the result
more suggestive of suburban bonnets than antiquity and quaintness.
Ask a boy Why? he will probably reply that “it always has been
done.” Change has come; it used to be held on Sundays during Lent
instead of Thursday as to-day, and up to absolutely recent years there
were six suppers instead of four. These festivals interfere somewhat
with school work, and those who are officially compelled to attend
find sameness, even in a public supper, in the course of thirty years or
so. As the clock strikes seven there is a rap, the boys stand up, the
organ bursts into “God save the Queen,” and up the hall marches the
Lord Mayor, preceded by the chief beadle of the Hospital, clad in
gorgeous raiment and a mace suggestive of a fish-slice. Behind comes
the treasurer of the Hospital, another alderman, and various governors,
each bearing a green stick to mark his office. These sit in reserved
seats at the far end of the hall, the Lord Mayor in <i>the</i> chair, while on
his right hand by the wall are masters and on his left some “officers.”
The ceremony—a strange mixture of a religious service, a meal, and a
feudal relic—begun with the reading of a passage from the Sermon on
the Mount by a Grecian standing in a pulpit, whence he proceeded to
read special prayers written for the school by Bishop Compton, ending
with the Lord’s Prayer, after which a hymn and “grace” and then
the supper, during which the Lord Mayor, with a select few, made
the grand tour of the hall. Such a supper was soon over, and it was
not long before the boys had gathered up the plates and bowls and
cloths and knives, and then came grace and an anthem well sung by a
well-trained choir. This was followed by the feudal feature in the
evening: the whole school, with the exception of the Grecians, “bows
round,” i.e. the boys walk up two and two, marshalled by two beadles,
who stand near, and drawing near the chair, then bow the head in
reverence to an Authority. Most boys have a “trade,” and in this
procession each one carries a symbol of that “trade.” The matron’s
special boy carries a bonnet-candle in each hand, the knife-boy carries
his knife-basket, and the cloth-boy takes his cloth neatly rolled beneath
his wing, while, last of all, the bread-boy hoists the tall bread-basket
shoulder-high and “bows round” with it, never failing to raise a
laugh as well as a basket. When all have bowed, the boy-marshalling
beadles bow also, and the revels are ended. It is believed that the
original purpose of these suppers was to rouse interest in the
outside public and possibly raise money from their pockets; at all
events, collection boxes used to be placed about the hall on those
occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pulling-out</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse: obsolete).—<span class='sc'>Pulling-out</span>
took place on Good Fridays. A line was

one side of this line stood the first and second
forms, <i>i.e.</i> the Uppers, on the other side of it the
Unders. The Unders had the right of calling on
any unpopular Upper to run the gauntlet between
two rows of Unders from cloister doors to a point
near the chapel. They armed themselves with
implements of all kinds, such as sticks, or stones
fastened into stockings, with which to inflict punishment
upon the Uppers. The latter naturally resisted;
hence there were fierce fights and dangerous
rushes. During the <span class='fss'>PULLING-OUT</span> of 1824, a little
fellow called Howard, a younger son of the Earl
of Suffolk, was entangled in one of these rushes,
dragged along the ground for some distance, with
a mass of boys upon him, and received injuries
from which he died soon after. This was the end

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 49. In the
short half we had at least one “<span class='fss'>REMEDY</span>,” and a half day every week,
and in summer two always; they were on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
These “<span class='fss'>REMEDIES</span>” were a kind of mitigated whole holidays. We
were supposed to go into school for an hour or two in the morning
and afternoon; but as no Master was present, it didn’t come
to much. This was called “Books Chambers.” <span class='sc'>Remedies</span> were
not a matter of right, but were always specially applied for by Præfect
of Hall on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The custom was for him to waylay
the Doctor on his way to morning chapel, and make the request,
when, if granted, a gold ring was handed to the applicant, on which
was engraved, “<i>commendant rarior usus</i>.” This ring was worn by
the Præfect of Hall for the rest of the day, and returned by him to the
Doctor at the beginning of middle school on the day following.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Remedy</span>. A holiday in

<span class='fss'>REMEDY</span> being often granted. Now Thursdays in Cloister-time only
are <span class='fss'>REMEDIES</span> proper in middle-school hours; there are on these days
Morning-lines, and the afternoon is a half-holiday. Ascension-Day and
the Queen’s Accession are <i>holidays</i>: all red-letter Saints’-days are
Leave-out-days. <i>Remedium</i> seems to have been the original word for
holiday: translated <span class='fss'>REMEDY</span>.... The tradition of <span class='fss'>REMEDIES</span> being

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, 316. Another ancient barbarism
survived even long after Butler’s accession. There were in the head-master’s
house two public rooms for the use of his boarders—the
hall and the play-room. The latter was open to all, but the hall was
regarded as a sort of club-room, which no boy was allowed to enter,
except at dinner and supper time, until he had become a member by
being <span class='fss'>ROLLED-IN</span>. Any one who desired the privilege of admission
(and none below the upper fifth were eligible), gave in his name to the
head-boy some days beforehand, in order that due preparations might
be made for the inauguration. Immediately a certain number of rolls
(<i>finds</i> they were called—etymology unknown) were ordered at the
baker’s, and rebaked every morning until they were pretty nearly as
hard as pebbles. At nine o’clock on the morning fixed for the <span class='fss'>ROLLING-IN</span>,
the members of the hall ranged themselves on the long table which
ran along one side of the room, each with his pile of these rolls before
him, and a fag to pick them up. The candidate knelt, facing them, on
a form close against the opposite wall, with his head resting on his
hands, so as to guard the face, while they held, as well as they could, a
plate on the top of the head by way of helmet. Thus protected, the
head itself formed a mark for the very peculiar missiles which were
ready to be aimed. When all was ready, a time-keeper, watch in
hand, gave the word—“Now!” when fast and furiously—and very
spitefully, if the boy was unpopular—the rolls were showered upon the
devoted head for the space of one minute, neither more nor less. Such
protection as the plate gave was soon lost by its being broken to pieces.
It was, as may be imagined, a very severe ordeal, the bruises being very
painful for weeks afterwards.</p>

In early Winchester football there seems to have been three methods
of scoring—a <i>goal</i>, a <i>gowner</i>, a <span class='fss'>SCHITT</span>, worth respectively 3, 2, and 1.
The last behind stood between two gowns, which made a goal. The
ball passing over his head or between his legs scored three, over the
gowns two, over the rest of “worms” one. When the whole of
“worms” was made to count equally, every goal was a <span class='fss'>SCHITT</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>What I Remember</i>.... The words “flog” or
“flogging,” it is to be observed, were never heard among us, in the
mouth either of the masters or the boys. We were <span class='fss'>SCOURGED</span>.</p>

(<i>c.</i> 1840).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scrub</b>, <i>verb</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—To write fast: <i>e.g.</i>
“<span class='fss'>SCRUB</span> it down.” Also as <i>subs.</i> = handwriting.
[Lat. <i>scribere</i>.] <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Strive</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scrubbing</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A flogging:
four strokes at <span class='fss'>SCRUBBING-FORMS</span>. <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Scourge</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 109. The ordinary
punishment consisted of four cuts, and was called “<span class='fss'>A SCRUBBING</span>.”
The individual who was to be punished was told “to order
his name,” which he did by going to the Ostiarius, and requesting
him to do so; that officer accordingly, at the end of school time, would
take his name to the Master, who would then call it out, and the
victim had to kneel down at Senior row, while two Juniors laid bare
the regulation space of his back. The first time a boy’s name was
ordered, the punishment was remitted on his pleading “<i>Primum
tempus</i>.” For a more serious breach of duty, a flogging of six cuts
(a “Bibler”) was administered, in which case the culprit had to “order
his name to the Bible-Clerk,” and that individual, with the help of
Ostiarius, performed the office of Jack Ketch. If a boy was detected
in a lie, or any very disgraceful proceeding—a rare occurrence, I am
happy to say—he had to stand up in the centre of Junior row during
the whole of the school time, immediately preceding the infliction of
the flogging; this pillory process was called a “Bibler under the
nail.” I have also heard, that for a very heinous offence, a boy might
be punished in Sixth Chamber, in which case the number of stripes
was not limited; but I never knew an instance of this.</p>

<p class='c012'>1864. <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, vol. xcv., p. 79. Underneath is the
place of execution, where delinquents are <span class='fss'>BIBLED</span>. <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 72. It
need hardly be said that it [the rod] is applied in the ordinary fashion:
six cuts forming what is technically called a <span class='fss'>BIBLING</span>—on which
occasions the Bible-Clerk introduces the victim; four being the sum
of a less terrible operation called a <span class='fss'>SCRUBBING</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Scrubbing</span>.... According
to T. A. Trollope, the word in use in his day was <span class='fss'>SCOURGING</span>:
this, however, he describes as of three strokes: he does not mention
“bibling.” He was in College 1820-28.</p>

which the boys may have to prefer. This is called the <span class='fss'>SCRUTINY</span>,

each chamber), are separately questioned; but complaints are seldom
made. Next morning the examination for election of scholars to New
College begins—no longer in the renowned “Election Chamber” itself,
but in the long “Warden Gallery,” as more convenient for the purpose;
all prefects who are of standing to leave the school are examined
with any other who choose.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Scrutiny</span>. An examination

in the relation of an apprentice. The new boy is called the
“<span class='fss'>SHADOW</span>,” the other, the “Substance.” For the first week the
<span class='fss'>SHADOW</span> follows the Substance everywhere, takes his place next to
him in class, accompanies him as he rises or falls, and is exempt
from any responsibility for his own mistakes in or out of school.
During this interval of indulgence, his patron is expected to initiate
him in all the work of the school, to see that he is provided with the
necessary books and other appliances, and, in short, to teach him by
degrees to enter upon a substantial and responsible existence of his
own.</p>

the story that at the beginning of this century, one of the men, who
sold fruits and tarts at the wall, got nicknamed <span class='fss'>SOCKS</span>, in consequence
of his having discarded knee-breeches and stockings in favour of pants
and short hose. The man’s nickname might then have spread to his business
and to his wares by a process familiar to etymologists, till <span class='fss'>SOCKING</span>
came to mean the purchase of good things not from <span class='fss'>SOCKS</span> only,

<p class='c012'>1870. <span class='sc'>Goodrich</span> [<span class='sc'>Webster</span>, <i>Unabridged</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Sophomose</span>]. This
word has generally been considered an American barbarism, but it was
probably introduced into our country at a very early period from the
University of Cambridge, England. Among the cant terms at that
University, as given in the “<i>Gradus ad Cantabrigiam</i>,” we find <span class='fss'>SOPH-MOR</span>
as the next distinctive appellation to Freshman. It is added that
a writer in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> thinks Mor an abbreviation of the
Greek μωρία, introduced at a time when the “Encomium Moriæ,” the
“Praise of Folly,” by Erasmus, was so generally used. The ordinary
derivation of the word, from σοφός and μωρός would seem, therefore, to
be incorrect. The young <span class='fss'>SOPHS</span> at Cambridge appear formerly to have
received the adjunct mor, μωρός, to their names, either as one they
courted for the reason mentioned above, or as one given them in sport
for the supposed exhibition of inflated feeling in entering upon their
new honours. The term thus implied seems to have passed at a very
early period from Cambridge in England to Cambridge in America, as
the next distinctive appellation to Freshmen, and thus to have been
attached to the second of the four classes in our American colleges,
while it has now almost ceased to be known, even as a cant word, at
the parent institution in England from whence it came.</p>

coffee, butter, &amp;c., to obtain a more decent meal
than was otherwise possible.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Spital Sermons</b> (Christ’s Hospital).—Once the chief
feature of the Easter festivities of this ancient
foundation. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

<p class='c012'>1834. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>History of Christ’s Hospital</i> [condensed and
annotated by the editor of <i>The Blue</i>]. All Easter festivities connected
with the School seem to be concentrated in the <span class='fss'>SPITAL SERMONS</span>. The
great antiquity of those discourses may be judged from the fact, that
at the Easter following the foundation and opening of the School
[1552], its members were present at St. Mary Spital. At this their first
appearance at the Spital the boys appeared in that costume which,
with the exception of the hats, still distinguishes them. A custom
had long prevailed, according to which some learned person was
appointed yearly by the Bishop of London to preach at Paul’s Cross
on Good Friday on the Passion; and on the Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday following, three others were appointed in like manner to
uphold the doctrine of the Resurrection, at the Pulpit Cross in the
Spital. On the Sunday following, a fifth preached at Paul’s Cross,
passed judgment on the merits of those who had preceded him, and
concluded the ceremony with an appropriate exhortation from himself.
What this passing of judgment meant, and what purpose it served, is
rather hard to decide. It would almost seem as if some prize or reward
were offered for the best sermon. The <span class='fss'>SPITAL SERMONS</span> are
certainly the oldest institution of their kind in London, and probably
in England. But they have naturally been subject to great changes.
At first there were five, two at Paul’s Cross and three at St. Mary
Spital. Many alterations followed; for instance, the Great Rebellion
put an end for a time both to pulpit and sermons, until the Restoration,
when they were revived, that is, the three <span class='fss'>SPITAL SERMONS</span>
proper (for the judge disappears) at St. Bride’s Church, which still
stands in Fleet Street. Nothing interrupted them again until 1797,
when the preachers once more were removed to Christ’s Church,
where the <span class='fss'>SERMONS</span>, now only two in number, have been regularly
delivered, until within the memory of many still in the school [1890]
the Corporation reduced their number to a minimum; and now one
<span class='fss'>SPITAL SERMON</span> instead of five is listened to, not at St. Mary Spital,
or Paul’s Cross, or St. Bride’s, but at Christ Church, Newgate Street.
Though the scene has not changed since 1797, the accompanying
ceremony has been sadly mutilated. In my [Mr. Trollope’s] time,
instead of the subjects which were wont to be discussed from the
Pulpit Cross of St. Mary Spital, discourses were delivered commemorative
of the five Sister Hospitals of Christ’s Hospital, St. Thomas’, St.
Bartholomew’s, Bridewell, and Bethlehem. This feature has almost
entirely disappeared; the reverend preachers now pass by, or casually
mention, the original reason for their presence in the handsome pulpit
of Christ Church. “On each day the boys of Christ’s Hospital, with
the legend ‘He is risen’ attached to their left shoulder, form part of
the Civic procession; walking on the first day in the order of their
schools, the King’s boys bearing their nautical instruments.” [These
King’s boys are, of course, the Mathemats, who seem in earlier days,
before the development of the Classical side, and the chances of a
University career, to have been the most prominent part of the School.]
They assembled on Monday in the Square of the Royal Exchange, and
on their return were joined by the Lord Mayor and Civic procession,
with the ladies. On Tuesday they proceeded direct to the Mansion
House; each boy received a new sixpence, each monitor a shilling,
and each Grecian half a guinea. [It appears that Alderman Thomson,
whose portrait hangs in the Hall, whose name is engraven on the walls
of the Hospital, and to whom we owe the Classical and Mathematical
Medals, doubled the donation in every case, and his successors have
not returned to the original amount.] The boys were again followed
by the Civic authorities, without the ladies, to Christ Church, where a
Junior Bishop preached on Monday, and a clergyman selected by the
Lord Mayor (usually his chaplain) on Tuesday. But the most interesting
feature of all was that on both occasions an anthem composed by
one of the Grecians, and set to music by the organist, was sung by
the children.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Spite</b>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To hate: to dislike.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 235. When a
boy suffered some injury himself, in order to spite another person; or
having in some way injured another, received punishment, he was
said to be <span class='fss'>SPITING GABELL</span>. Dr. Gabell was formerly Head-master,
and the extreme inexpediency of attempting to annoy him gave rise to
the proverb.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Spite.</span> The word in
Wykehamical usage generally connoted the frame of mind rather than
the acts in which it finds expression. But the phrase “to <span class='fss'>SPITE</span> Gabell”
describes the act popularly known as “cutting off your nose to <span class='fss'>SPITE</span>
your face.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Splice</b>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To throw; to fling: as a
missile.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sport</b>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To spread: as a baulk (or
report); to wear: as clothes; to provide: as a
feast; to indulge in: as smoking, walking, &amp;c.—a
general verb of action. Whence <span class='fss'>SPORTING ACTION</span>
= an affected manner, gesture, or gait, or betrayal of
emotion. [<i>Sport</i> (var. dial.) = to show, to exhibit.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sportings</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—Clothes worn at the
<span class='sc'>Exeat</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <span class='sc'>Tod</span>, <i>Charterhouse</i>, p. 102. The splendour of Exeat garb defies
description. It is enough to say that the Carthusian’s apparel then is
as costly as his purse will buy, and that he calls it <span class='fss'>SPORTINGS</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Spree</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Winchester).—(1) Conceited; stuck-up: of
persons. (2) Smart; stylish; befitting a Wykehamist:
of dress, &amp;c. [<i>Spree</i> (Devon) = spruce, gay.]</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 72. At the
end of the half year we used to have large entertainments called
“<span class='fss'>SPREE MESSES</span>,” between Toy-time and Chapel, consisting of tea,
coffee, muffins, cakes, &amp;c., the funds for which were generally provided
by fines inflicted during Toy-time for talking loud, slamming the
door, coming in without whistling (to show that it was not a Master
entering), improper language, &amp;c. &amp;c. Sometimes a <span class='fss'>SPREE MESS</span> was
given by the boys about to leave at the end of that Half.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Spree</span>.... As applied
to juniors, uppish; inclined to assume airs, or usurp privileges not
belonging to juniors. As applied to acts, permissible only to prefects
or those of senior standing.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Spreeman</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A Junior who has to
fag hard.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Spreeman</span>. A Commoner
Inferior, who, in consideration of his social status or long
standing in the School, was invested by Præfects with privileges
similar to those enjoyed by Candle-keepers in College.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squab</b> (or <b>Squob</b>), <i>verb</i> (King Edward’s, Birm.).—To
squeeze by. [The foot is placed against a wall or
desk, and the back against the victim, who is
similarly treated from the opposite side by some
one else, or pressed against a wall.] Hence <span class='fss'>SQUAB-UP</span>
= “push,” generally. [<i>Squab</i> (Devon) = to
squeeze, to knock, to beat.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Square.</b> <span class='sc'>To square round</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Winchester).—To
make room: as at a fire, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squash</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Stonyhurst).—A mellay (at football) of
the two sides round the goal-posts. A goal secured
in this way is called a “squash-goal.” Also Harrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>1876. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i> [Harrow], p. 312. The gravel
cut the leather case of the ball occasionally, as well as the hands and
faces of those who scrambled over it in a <span class='fss'>SQUASH</span>, as that close <i>mêlée</i>
is called, which Rugby men know as a “scrummage,” and Etonians as
a “rouge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>1885. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, i. 144. The second law on the Code enacts
that “no one may push, pull, charge, or trip another player.” How
then is a <span class='fss'>SQUASH GOAL</span> to be accounted for?</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Harrow).—A game of racquets not played
with a <span class='sc'>Harder</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), but with an indiarubber ball,
which is also called a <span class='fss'>SQUASH</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squashed-flies.</b> <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Flies</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squeaky</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—High-pitched: of
the voice. <i>Cf.</i> <span class='sc'>Gruff</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1844. <i>Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital</i> [<i>The Blue</i>, Aug. 1874]. The
voices, in our own peculiar phraseology, being divided into two classes—those
who sang <span class='fss'>SQUEAKY</span> and those who sang <span class='fss'>GRUFF</span>. The monitors
were constantly on the look-out for boys with <span class='fss'>SQUEAKY</span> voices, and
did any youth make himself at all prominent in this respect, down
upon him would pounce the monitor, forthwith to <i>transpose</i> him to the
organ gallery, there to submit his musical abilities to a trial by the
organist. The latter was an elderly gentleman, inclined at times to be
rather irritable.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squealer</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Wellington).—A small boy.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squirm</b> (or <b>Squirt</b>), <i>subs.</i> (general).—An obnoxious boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Winchester).—Weak tea.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Squo</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Charterhouse).—<span class='sc'>Squash</span> (<i>q.v.</i>); as in <span class='fss'>SQUO</span>-court,
<span class='fss'>SQUO</span>-ball, <span class='fss'>SQUO</span>-bat, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stally</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Derby).—Strong [? stalwart].</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stamp</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Every one is provided with a
“school stamp”; the name is cut on it, and this
must be printed on all books, &amp;c. Above the
Second Fifth boys keep their own stamp.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stand.</b> <span class='sc'>To stand out for College</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i>
(Westminster).—To enter for a King’s scholarship.
Candidates must be under fifteen years of age, and
have been in the school as a town boy for not less
than a year preceding.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 182. Then if he thinks proper
he “<span class='fss'>STANDS OUT FOR COLLEGE</span>”—or, in the old Latin phraseology, becomes
one of the <i>minores candidati</i>. He undergoes a very severe
examination, called the “Challenge” [<i>q.v.</i>], the form of which must
have been preserved from Queen Elizabeth’s days, and is the last
surviving relic of the old scholastic disputations; those tournaments
of Latin and logic, in which Queen Bess was wont to reward a successful
champion with a purse of gold from her own virgin hand, and her
successor, James, distributed liberally the more economical guerdon of
royal applause and criticism.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Standing-up Week</b>, <i>subs. phr.</i> (Winchester).—<i>See</i> quot.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 235. <span class='sc'>Standing-up
week</span>—During the last week of Long Half all the boys,
except Sixth Book and Senior Part, had to say a number of lines by
heart in eight lessons, which they were supposed to have learned in
the course of the previous year; this was called <span class='fss'>STANDING-UP</span>. Marks
were given according to merit, and these marks had a very material
effect on the respective positions of the boys in their Parts.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Station.</b> <span class='sc'>On station</span>, <i>adv. phr.</i> (Westminster).—The
attendance, by juniors, on the games in the
“Green” in Great Dean’s Yard, or, on a rainy day,
in College.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 186. The juniors are expected
to remain <span class='fss'>ON STATION</span> in college for the short intervals after
breakfast and after dinner, and at other times in the playgrounds (the
“Green” in Dean’s Yard or Vincent Square, according to the time of
year or the game that happens to be in season); except on decidedly
wet days, when <span class='fss'>STATION</span> is always in college.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Statue</b> (The), <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A statue of the Virgin
looked after by the boys. They have “Month of

honour.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Brinsley-Richards</span>, <i>Seven Years at Eton</i>. Sometimes Blazes

<p class='c012'>1866-72. “<span class='sc'>Mac</span>,” <i>Sketchy Memories of Eton</i>. Many things at Eton
were called by misnomers, in the construction of which the <i>lucus a non

said we were <span class='fss'>STAYING OUT</span>; when “absence” was called, we had to
be <i>present</i>; a <i>third</i> of a year was called a <i>half</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Rugby).—To go on the sick-list.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stedman promo</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—An unexpected
(and probably undeserved) promotion. [Because
announced in the lists printed by Mr. R. B.
Stedman, the school bookseller at Godalming.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>-ster</b>, <i>inseparable suffix</i> (Winchester).—The termination
agent: as Brockster, Mugster, Thokester, Quilster,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stew</b>, <i>verb</i> (Stonyhurst).—To study. Whence <span class='sc'>Stew-pot</span>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 236. <span class='sc'>Sticking-up.</span>—On
the last three Fridays of each Half, a boy was selected by
appointment of Commoner Præfects and Course-keeper, and placed on
the top of <span class='sc'>Toys</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) in their Hall, and was pelted with <span class='sc'>Pontos</span> (<i>q.v.</i>)
by the rest. The following <span class='sc'>Peals</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) were chanted previously, one
on each day: “Locks and Keys,” “Boots and Leathers,” and “Gomer
Hats.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stick-ups</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—Stand-up, or high collars:
as opposed to “turn-downs.” The rules as to
collars are very intricate, and differ in various
Houses. At Charterhouse <span class='fss'>STICK-UPS</span> are not permissible
until the end of the first year.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stinks</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—Chemistry. Also as a nickname

<p class='c010'><b>Stone</b> (The), <i>subs.</i> (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—The
Steward’s table in Hall. <span class='sc'>To go to the stone</span> = to go
up for trial, judgment, and sentence for misconduct.</p>

<p class='c012'>1844. <i>Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital</i> [<i>The Blue</i>, Aug. 1874]. With
respect to misconduct out of school hours, the several monitors were
the police, and the Steward the sole judge. When first appointed, the
young monitors displayed excessive zeal in the discovery of delinquencies,
and would call out with as much severity as it was possible
to throw into the voice of a youth of fourteen, “Go to <span class='fss'>THE STONE</span>,
you, sir!” “<span class='sc'>The stone</span>” was the name given to the Steward’s table
in the Hall, where offenders were tried, judgment delivered, and
sentence carried out, immediately after meals. The mildest punishment
consisted of caning on the open hand (ironically termed
“cakes”), and next in severity was flogging with the birch (called
“brushing”); and Fate, with a grim sense of humour which we failed
to appreciate at the time, decreed that the head beadle in our time,
who was appointed to administer the said brushings and cakes, should
bear the appropriate name of Honey.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stonyhurst-cricket</b> (or <b>Football</b>). <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stop.</b> <span class='sc'>To stop out</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Harrow and Charterhouse).—To

Cricket Eleven.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Rugby).—For two years after his first term
(during which a silk hat or “topper” was <i>de rigueur</i>)
a boy wears a black-and-white speckled straw hat
with a black ribbon. Each House has its own
distinctive ribbon. At the end of his third year a

I had always imagined it to be an East Anglian word for “kick,” but

When a player has kicked the ball well forward, and has followed it,

does not generally form part of a boy’s outfit, Bully would proceed to
furnish him with a pair in the following manner:—Taking a half consumed
stick from the fire, he would draw the “red-hot end” down
the back of Green’s hand between each of the knuckles to the wrist,
and having produced three satisfactory lines of blisters would then
make two or three transverse lines across. A scientifically fitted pair

I remember now; it was that brute A—— who “to <span class='fss'>FITTI</span>”-ed me last
night.... For the benefit of the uninitiated let me explain the <i>modus
operandi</i> and its etymology: it is nothing more or less than the commencement
of a line in the old familiar “<i>As in præsenti perfectum,
format in avi</i>,” which we used to learn, “<i>to fit-ti</i>,” in reference to verbs
of the third conjugation, transferred from the similarity of sound to
the school-boy’s toe; it consisted in tying a running noose on a piece
of string, cunningly turning up the bed-clothes at the foot, putting it
round the big toe of an unconscious sleeper, running the noose up
tight, and pulling till the victim followed the direction of string from
the pain, getting farther and farther out of bed and nearer and nearer
the floor, till mercifully released.</p>

early chapel, rushed out of gates, each bearing a
burning birch-broom, up College Street and along
the wall of the Close up to the old White Hart

<p class='c010'><b>Town and Gown</b>, <i>sub. phr.</i> (University).—The townsmen
<i>v.</i> the members of the University. [In her young
days the position of the University was one of perpetual
conflict—with the town, the Jews, the Friars,
and the Papal Court.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span>, <i>Verdant Green</i>, <span class='fss'>II.</span> iii. <span class='sc'>Town and gown</span> disturbances
are of considerable antiquity. Fuller and Matthew Paris
give accounts of some which occurred as early as the year 1238. These
disputes not unfrequently terminated fatally to some of the combatants.
One of the most serious <span class='fss'>TOWN AND GOWN</span> rows on record took
place on the day of St. Scholastica the Virgin, February 10, 1345, when
several lives were lost on either side. The University was at that time
in the Lincoln diocese; and Grostête, the bishop, placed the townspeople
under an interdict, from which they were not released till 1357,
and then only on condition that the mayor and sixty of the chief burgesses
should on every anniversary of the day of St. Scholastica,
attend St. Mary’s Church and offer up mass for the soul of the slain
scholars, and should also individually present an offering of one penny
at the high altar. They, moreover, paid a yearly fine of 100 marks to
the University, with the penalty of an additional fine of the same sum
for every omission in attending at St. Mary’s. This continued up to
the time of the Reformation, when it gradually fell into abeyance. In
the fifteenth year of Elizabeth, however, the University asserted their
claim to all arrears. The matter being brought to trial, it was decided
that the town should continue the annual fine and penance, though
the arrears were forgiven. The fine was yearly paid on the 10th of
February up to our own time; the mayor and chief burgesses attended
at St. Mary’s and made the offering at the conclusion of the litany,
which, on that occasion, was read from the altar. This was at length
put an end to by Convocation in the year 1825.</p>

<p class='c012'>1899. <span class='sc'>Heywood</span>, <i>Guide to Oxford</i>. The <span class='fss'>TOWN AND GOWN</span> rows, as
occasions for displays of physical force, lasted until quite recent times,
as readers of <i>Verdant Green</i> and <i>Tom Brown at Oxford</i> will know.
Nowadays, however, they are happily unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Townee</b> (or <b>Towner</b>), <i>subs.</i> (general).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Cad</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Towney</b> (Christ’s Hospital).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Housey</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1887. <i>The Blue</i>, Nov. Thus, a little farther on, mention is made of
the time when a boy leaves the School. The consequent change of
dress might be vulgarly expressed by “exchanging <span class='fss'>HOUSEYS FOR
TOWNEYS</span>,” but our author is before all things refined. “The boy is at
liberty to exchange the garb of the house for one more congenial to
modern taste.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Town-lout</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Rugby).—A scholar residing in the
town with his parents.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Toys</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—A bureau—desk and book-case
combined. Whence <span class='fss'>TOY-TIME</span> (or <span class='fss'>TOYS</span>) = evening
preparation (in College) and (in Commoners) all
time so spent.</p>

<p class='c012'>1440. <i>Prompt. Parv.</i> <i>Teye</i>, of a cofyr or forcer.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <span class='sc'>Wrench</span>, <i>Winchester Word-Book</i>, s.v. <span class='sc'>Toys</span>.... The expression
<span class='fss'>TOY-TIME</span> suggests that the “s” has been added. If <span class='fss'>TOYS</span> has
not descended from this word [teye], it must have been transferred
from the contents of the toys, and mean simply <i>one’s belongings</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Trades</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—<i>See</i> quot. and <span class='sc'>Public-supping</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1900. <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 16th March, “London Day by Day.” After
the boys had concluded their simple repast of tea and bread-and-butter,
they formed up two-and-two, and bowed to the Lord Mayor,
the different wards being headed by the <span class='fss'>TRADES</span>, as the boys who
carry the candlesticks, the bread-basket, table-cloth, and cutlery are
termed.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Travelling-scholarship</b> (or <b>Fellowship</b>), <i>subs.</i> (University).—<span class='sc'>Rustication</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Treacle-bolly</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Marlborough). A walk by the
Kennett close to the College. [So called from the
cottage of a miller so nick-named.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tree of Knowledge, The</b> (Charterhouse).—The tree
under which books, &amp;c., are piled in the interval
between second school and dinner (say 12.30 to
1.15), while run-about in winter and cricket-nets
or position drill in summer is engaged in.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Treer</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Durham: obsolete).—A boy who avoids
organised games, but plays a private game with
one or two friends. [Presumably because played
by the trees at the side of the ground.]</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Trek</b>, <i>verb</i> (Durham).—To run.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Trencher</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (Winchester).—A square wooden
platter: in use in College.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (general).—A college cap; a <span class='sc'>Mortar-board</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Trial</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—An examination. Whence
<span class='sc'>Trials</span> = the examinations at the end of the summer
and winter terms.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tribune</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A large pew in
ante-chapel: reserved for ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tripos</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Cambridge).—A word dating from the
sixteenth century, and used successively in a
number of different senses. At first it was applied
to the stool on which the champion of the University
sat at the disputations held at the admission
of Bachelors of Arts to their degree; then it was
transferred to the Bachelor himself; still later to
the humorous, or, in some cases, scurrilous, speech
with which “Mr. Tripos” opened the proceedings,
and to the verses of the Bachelors at the Acts.
The honours-lists were printed (about 1847-8) on
the backs of these verses, and so tripos came to
mean an honour-list, and, last of all, the examination
itself. Until the year 1824 there was only
one tripos, the Mathematical; and up to 1850 only
those who had obtained honours in mathematics
were admitted to the Classical examination. The
degree was not given for that examination till a
few years later.</p>

<p class='c012'>1877. <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span>, <i>Scholæ Academicæ</i>, 20. Such interest as is
now attached to them belongs rather to the verses than to the list
of the several <span class='fss'>TRIPOSES</span> (for the name has now at last come to signify
degree examinations) which have been circulated already severally.</p>

<p class='c012'>1891. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i>, 9. I’m seriously thinking of
chucking my <span class='fss'>TRIPOS</span> and taking up the History Special.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Trotter</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—A tailor’s assistant who
goes on round for orders.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Truck-house</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The Recreation
rooms.</p>

<p class='c012'>1882. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, i. 12, “Rummagings amongst our Records.”
Grammar and Great Figures on their Declamation day ...
were exempted from studies and allowed something of a collation in
the <span class='fss'>TRUCK-HOUSE</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tub</b>, <i>subs.</i> 1. (University).—A boat broad in the beam,
used by novices. Hence <span class='fss'>TUBBING</span> = boating; to <span class='fss'>GET
TUBBED</span> = to be taught to row.</p>

<p class='c012'>1853. <span class='sc'>Bradley</span>, <i>Verdant Green</i>.... So to the river he next day
went, and made his first essay in a <span class='fss'>TUB</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1889. <i>Morning Advertiser.</i> If “up” at the University, we will probably
pass our time between “grinding hard” and <span class='fss'>TUBBING</span> on the
river.</p>

<p class='c012'>1898. <i>Stonyhurst Mag.</i>, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” Rowing is
naturally a great attraction to many freshmen, and every College is
always on the look-out for new oarsmen. What one does is to get
“<span class='fss'>TUBBED</span>,” that is, one is taught to row by members of the College
eight in boats that are too <span class='fss'>TUB</span>-like to be easily capsized.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. (Winchester).—A chest in Hall into which
<span class='sc'>Dispars</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) not taken by the boys were put.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>c.</i> 1840. <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>, <i>School-Life at Winchester</i> (1866), 79. In front of
the screen stood “<span class='fss'>TUB</span>,” from which the Præfect of that Ilk took his
title; it was a strong painted oak chest, with a lid, about two feet
high.... As will be seen, it was simply impossible for the Juniors to
be up to time, the consequence of which was that more than half the
dinners were not taken; these were thrown into “<span class='fss'>TUB</span>” at the end
of Hall, whence they were ultimately taken away by some poor women,
and I always understood (though I am not certain that such was the
case) that the “Præfect of <span class='fss'>TUB</span>” got a certain sum for each “Dispar”
not taken, and so had a direct interest in managing that as many as
possible should go without their dinner. I will now explain the absence
of the Juniors; immediately the Præfects were seated, the whole Hall
resounded with shouts of “Junior—Junior—Junior,” rising in savageness
of tone, as the supply became exhausted; in five minutes all the
Juniors were darting wildly about in all directions, executing orders
received from their lords and masters; some to Colson’s hatch for
salt, or down in the cellar for beer, back to school for something forgotten,
into chambers for a pint cup, down to the kitchen for gravy,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c012'>1867. <span class='sc'>Collins</span>, <i>The Public Schools</i>, p. 23. Until the last few
years the “præfect of <span class='fss'>TUB</span>” (whose duty it was to examine the
quality of the meat sent in by the college butcher, and after dinner
to see to the proper collection and distribution of the remains)
retained his title.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tub-mess</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—The table at which the
Senior Præfects sat in Hall.—<span class='sc'>Mansfield</span> (<i>c.</i> 1840).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tuck</b>, <i>subs.</i> (general).—Edibles of all kinds, but particularly
pastry. Hence <span class='fss'>TUCK-SHOP</span> = a pastry-cook’s.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tuck-parcel</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A hamper from

he didn’t take much exercise and ate too much <span class='fss'>TUCK</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tug</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—A Colleger; a scholar on the
foundation. Whence <span class='fss'>TUGGERY</span> = College.</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <span class='sc'>Pascoe</span>, <i>Everyday Life in our Public Schools</i>.... The long
looked-for St. Andrew’s Day arrives, when the great match of collegers,
or, as the small oppidan would term it, <span class='fss'>TUGS</span>, and oppidans is
to be played.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Brinsley-Richards</span>, <i>Seven Years at Eton</i>.... My interlocutor
was a red-headed freckled little boy of eleven, who had come
from Aberdeen “to try for <span class='fss'>TUGGERY</span>,” that is, to try and pass in to
the foundation as a King’s Scholar.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 52. The Collegers did not always fare
as bravely as they do now, either at board or bed. Terrible tales of
their manner of life may be read.... Perhaps the recollections of
that time caused the disrespect, almost bordering on contempt, with
which the Oppidans used for many years to regard the <i>Togati</i>, or
gown-wearing boys. [<i>Note.</i>—I suppose there is not much doubt that
the nickname of <span class='fss'>TUG</span> by which the Collegers used to go among the
rest of the school, was derived from the <i>toga</i> they wore.]</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Adj.</i> (Winchester) = stale; ordinary; vapid; common.
Whence <span class='fss'>TUGS</span> = stale news; <span class='fss'>TUG-CLOTHES</span> =
everyday clothes; <span class='fss'>TUG-JAW</span> = wearisome talk.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tui</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester).—Tuition.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tumbies</b>, <i>subs.</i> (University).—Ablutions.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Tund</b>, <i>verb</i> (Winchester).—To thrash. Whence <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span>
= a thrashing. [Lat. <i>tundere</i>.]</p>

<p class='c012'>1881. <span class='sc'>Pascoe</span>, <i>Everyday Life in Our Public Schools</i>.... I never
heard of any case in Eton like the <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span> which, some years ago,
brought our mother-school into disagreeable notice.</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>What I Remember</i>.... It was the prefect of hall
who ordered the infliction of a public <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span>.... The following
simple and truthful statement of what a public <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span> was may
enable those who take an interest in the matter to form some reasonable
opinion whether the infliction of such punishment were a good
or a bad thing.... Some dozen or so of boys, who had the best
capacities for the performance, were appointed by him for the purpose,
and the whole assembly stood around the daïs, while the hymn <i>Te de
profundis</i> was sung. When all were thus assembled, and before the
singers commenced, the culprit who had been sentenced to a <span class='fss'>TUNDING</span>
stepped out, pulled off his gown, and received from the hands of one
deputed by the “prefect of hall,” and armed with a tough, pliant,
ground-ash stick, a severe beating.</p>

<p class='c012'>1866-72. <i>Sketchy Memories of Eton....</i> Being called a <span class='fss'>VILE-CHILD</span>, the
which I subsequently learnt was a very frequent term of mild reproach,
and had no particular reference to the age of the individual to whom
it was addressed. As a proof of this I may add that, being at Eton
for the Winchester Match in 1883, I (<i>moi-qui-vous-parle</i>, height 6 feet
2 inches, and weight 14 stone 7 lbs.) was called a <span class='fss'>VILE-CHILD</span> for being
on a committee to oppose a certain obnoxious Indian Bill! I wasn’t

<p class='c010'><b>Vocab</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Charterhouse).—A vocabulary.</p>

(<i>c.</i> 1840).</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Vulgus</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Winchester: obsolete).—A Latin epigram:
four or six lines long. Hence <span class='fss'>VULGUS-BOOK</span> = a
<span class='fss'>CRIB</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class='c012'>1883. <span class='sc'>Trollope</span>, <i>What I Remember</i>.... The mention of a <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span>
requires some explanation. Every inferior, <i>i.e.</i> non-prefect, in the
school was required every night to produce a copy of verses of from
two to six lines on a given theme—four or six lines for the upper
classes, two for the lowest. This was independent of a weekly verse
task of greater length, and was called a <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span>, I suppose, because
everybody—the <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span>—had to do it.</p>

<p class='c012'>1856. <span class='sc'>Hughes</span>, <i>Tom Brown’s School-days</i>, <span class='fss'>II</span>. iii. The <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span>
(commonly supposed to have been established by William of Wykeham
at Winchester, and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for the sake of
the lines which were learnt by heart with it than for its own intrinsic
value, as I’ve always understood), ... is a short exercise in Greek or
Latin verse, on a given subject, the minimum number of lines being
fixed for each form.... At Rugby <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span> and lines were the first
lesson every other day in the week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays; and ... it is obvious ... that the master of each Form
had to set one hundred and fourteen subjects every year.... Now,
human nature being prone to repeat itself, it will not be wondered that
the masters gave the same subjects sometimes over again after a
certain lapse of time. To meet and rebuke this bad habit of the
masters, the school-boy mind, with its accustomed ingenuity, had
invented an elaborate system of tradition. Almost every boy kept his
own <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span> written out in a book ... duly handed down from boy
to boy, till ... popular boys, in whose hands bequeathed <span class='fss'>VULGUS-BOOKS</span>
have accumulated, are prepared with three or four <span class='fss'>VULGUSES</span>
on any subject in heaven or earth, or in “more worlds than one,” which
an unfortunate master can pitch upon.... The only objection to the
traditionary method of doing your <span class='fss'>VULGUSES</span> was, the risk that the
successions might have become confused, and so that you and another
follower of traditions should show up the same identical <span class='fss'>VULGUS</span> some
fine morning; in which case, when it happened, considerable grief was
the result.</p>

<p class='c012'>1890. <i>Great Public Schools</i>, 26. There are, as is well known, two

<span class='fss'>FIELD</span>. The first is only played by a very limited number of boys, for
there is but one <span class='fss'>WALL</span>; the game is of a mysterious and intricate
nature, and the uninitiated spectator cannot as a rule even see how a
point (called a <span class='sc'>Shy</span>) is obtained. Indeed were it not for the time-honoured

the game would probably become obsolete.... The Eton <span class='fss'>FIELD</span>

In it speed and skilful dribbling and accurate kicking have their

and <span class='sc'>Westminster Play</span>. Besides these are others
worthy of mention:—</p>

<p class='c011'>1. <span class='sc'>The College Waistcoat.</span>—A remarkable and
original service was, up to the date of the Public
Schools Commission, exacted of a Westminster
junior. He was supposed to be a treasury of small
conveniences for his seniors’ use in and out of
school. He wore a college waistcoat of peculiar
pattern, in the pockets of which he had to carry
about and produce immediately on legal demand—the
items are recorded in the published evidence—two
penknives, two pieces of india-rubber, two
pencils, two pieces of sealing-wax, two pieces of pen-string,
two dips (<i>q.v.</i>), two dip-corks, two wedges,
two pieces of gutta-percha (for putting on the points
of foils), and any number of pens. Besides, he
had to carry a portfolio containing a sufficiency of
“quarterns” of paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. <span class='sc'>Latin Formulæ.</span>—Quaint old Latin formulæ
continued in use at Westminster, unchanged since
its earliest foundation. While the school is at
morning lesson, the <i>monitor ostii</i> (<i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Monos</span>)
watches the clock, and at half-past eleven comes to
the monitor of school and announces the time.
The monitor goes to the head-master’s desk, makes
his bow, and says, “<i>Sesqui est undecima</i>.” At a
quarter to twelve he makes the further announcement,
“<i>Instat duodecima</i>.” When twelve o’clock
has struck he says again, “<i>Sonuit duodecima</i>;” at
a quarter-past twelve, “<i>Prima quarta acta est</i>;”
at half-past, “<i>Sesqui est duodecima</i>,” at which
welcome words books are shut, and the whole school
is dismissed. The same formalities, with the necessary
variations, are repeated during afternoon lessons.
Before dinner the Captain calls out two boys of the
Second Election, one to say grace—“<i>Age gratias</i>”—and
the other to repeat the proper responses—“<i>Agite responsa</i>;”
and when dinner is over, before
grace again, he pays even the juniors the compliment
of asking whether they have had enough—“<i>Satisne
edistis et bibistis?</i>” to which the compulsory
answer is made—in old times too often by
hungry lips—“<i>Satis edimus et bibimus</i>.” Every
night at ten o’clock the monitor of chamber gives
the order for the juniors to put out the lights and
go to bed—“<i>Extinctis lucernis intrate lectos</i>.” It
is only within the last generation or two that the
rule of speaking Latin exclusively, both by boys
and masters, during school hours has fallen into
abeyance.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Westminster Play.</b>—A Latin comedy, presented annually
in the dormitory of St. Peter’s College, a
custom dating from Queen Elizabeth’s days. The
performances take place just before the Christmas
holidays, the play being repeated three times. The
cast is strictly confined to the forty scholars on
the foundation. At the close of last presentation
a <span class='sc'>Cap</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) is collected, the surplus of
which, after paying expenses, is divided among
the performers.</p>

“in the boats.” The school was divided between <span class='fss'>WET-BOBS</span> and dry-bobs,

called the Mathematical Tripos, those placed in the
second class being known as Senior Optimes, and
those in the third class as Junior Optimes. Up to
and including the year 1882, the student who took
absolutely the first place in the Mathematical Tripos
used to be termed Senior Wrangler; those who came
next to him being second, third, fourth, &amp;c., wranglers.
Since then the title has been given to the
student who takes the first place in Part I. of the
Mathematical Tripos. The name is derived from
the public disputations, in which candidates for
degrees were formerly required to exhibit their
powers.</p>

<p class='c012'>1870. <i>The Blue</i>, March. We were rejoiced to hear of the University
success of a late Grecian—G. A. Greenhill, who was announced as
Second <span class='fss'>WRANGLER</span> in the late Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge.
Further on in the month we heard of his being bracketed with Mr.
Pendlebury (the Senior <span class='fss'>WRANGLER</span>) as Smith’s Prizeman, a thing
seldom heard of at Cambridge, and never before has any Blue attained
that high honour.</p>

The boys of Durham School (and they

the Cathedral as “the Abbey.” This is
supposed to show that the school dates from pre-Reformation
days, though its foundation is put
down to the time of Henry VIII. The Charity

sort a cricket-bat. It was played against a buttress,
on which was marked a circle in chalk, which served
as a wicket. The ball was soft, with a hole in it;
as in rounders the batsman might insist on certain

<p class='c018'>The most distinctive feature in the <span class='fss'>MATHEMAT</span> life was the yearly
“going to Court.” Our hair was trimmed and brushed for the occasion
by the Hospital barber, buttonholes and gloves lavished on us.
When we went to Buckingham Palace we drove five in a carriage,
the redundant gentleman being literally and metaphorically sat upon
by his justly indignant comrades. But more interesting were our
visits to Windsor, with the march from the station to the Castle, the
long weary waiting in endless corridors and gorgeous ante-chambers,
the well-earned lunch, with John Brown peeping in at the door; then
Her Majesty’s inspection of our drawings; and finally, our free range
over the Castle and toilsome ascent of the Round Tower. I remember
the following circumstance: One <span class='fss'>MATHEMAT</span> exhibited a painting of
a ship still building. Prince George of Wales remarked to his brother,
“What a ‘rummy’ ship,” at which the exhibitor laughed, causing the

the Lord Mayor’s chaplain preached on Easter
Monday, a bishop on Tuesday, but within the last

<p class='c020'><b>Stonyhurst-cricket</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst: recently obsolete).—A
form of cricket played till very recent
times at Stonyhurst, the ordinary game being
known as <span class='sc'>London-cricket</span>. The points of difference
are chiefly these: (1) the balls must be
swift, and bowled along the ground; (2) the batsman
must hit—“slog” is the term; and (3) the
game is played at a single wicket. Bat, ball, and
wickets differ in shape and size from those used in
cricket proper. In Father Gerard’s <i>Stonyhurst</i>
will be found a detailed account of the game, and
a connection is traced between it and a crude form
once played at Eton. It is in all probability a
survival of very primitive cricket which became
stereotyped because of the life of the College abroad.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Stonyhurst-football</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A kind of
football played at Stonyhurst and some other
schools. It differs materially from the Association
and Rugby game, chiefly in these respects: (1) any
number may play at once; (2) the ball may be
touched by the hand during the game, but not
handled or carried as in Rugby football; (3) charging,
or otherwise roughly treating another player, is
prohibited. The goal-posts are longer and the
space between them narrower than in other forms
of the game; the ball is small and round. It is
akin to a species of football played at Eton, and is
clearly a relic of the past. In matches the sides
usually have names: <i>e.g.</i> “French and English,”
in the Grand Matches—a significant survival from
old continental days; “Federals and Allies” (now
obsolete); “Pipes and Windows”—a favourite impromptu
match, the “Pipes” being those who sit
on one side of the old “Study Place,” the “Windows”
those who sit on the other. Now that the
“Pipes” (hot-water pipes) are on the same side as
the windows, the match is more commonly called
“Walls and Windows,” but sometimes “Chapel
Pipes and Windows.” “Shavers and Non-shavers”
is another favourite match.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Superd.</b> <span class='sc'>To be superd</span>, <i>verb. phr.</i> (Harrow).—To be

<p class='c020'><b>Swack</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—Deception. Whence
<span class='sc'>To swack up</span> = to deceive; to take in.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Swagger</b> (or <b>Side</b>), <i>subs.</i> (Harrow).—(1) Appropriating
privileges to which one has no right; and (2)
using peculiar privileges which others may not use.
Etiquette in this respect is very complex.</p>

<p class='c021'>1898. <span class='sc'>Warner</span>, <i>Harrow School</i>, 280. The rules of “<span class='fss'>SWAGGER</span>” are
most complex, like other traditional and unwritten codes, and in them
a new boy is apt to find himself entangled. He goes out with his
umbrella rolled up, and he finds he is swaggering; or he carries it by
its middle, or under his arm, or he walks on the middle terrace after
chapel, or he innocently wears his “blues” open when it is hot, or
turns his trousers up when it is wet, and again he is swaggering.
Lady visitors sometimes think small boys at Harrow rude. It is not
rudeness which leads boys to stick close to the wall, even when coming
up covered with mud from football, and shoulder the world into the
gutter, it is modesty; to walk in the road is <span class='fss'>SWAGGER</span>. To loiter at
the house door, or to sing or whistle in the passages, and to wear a hat
in the house are also forms of <span class='fss'>SWAGGER</span>.</p>

sing in time.</p>

<p class='c021'>1898. <span class='sc'>Howson</span> and <span class='sc'>Warner</span>, <i>Harrow School</i>, 208. Then followed
solos from those who could sing and those who could not—it made no
difference. The latter class were called <span class='fss'>TALKERS</span>, and every boy was
encouraged to stand up and “talk it out.”</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Tap</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—Originally the <span class='sc'>Christopher</span> (<i>q.v.</i>).
Now the only place recognised by the authorities
where a boy can get beer.</p>

indulged in by classes at the end of the school
year.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Temple of Bel[l], The</b> (Royal High School, Edin.:
obsolete).—A square tower at the north-east
corner of the playground in which the bell was
formerly hung: now rendered invisible by the new

<p class='c020'><b>Tolly-shop</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Prefect’s-room</span>.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Tolly-ticket</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A custom now generally

It used to be common, and consisted in giving a
boy a card of good conduct as a reward for specially
good work. If, later, he were to incur punishment
for some offence, he would produce this card, and,
unless the offence were too grave, could thereby receive
a free pardon. Such cards were called <span class='fss'>TOLLY
TICKETS</span> or <span class='sc'>Immunity Cards</span>. [A precisely similar

<p class='c020'><b>Victory-walk</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Stonyhurst).—A recognised
reward given every half-term to the
classes of the <span class='sc'>Lower Line</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). The system is
as follows:—Each class is divided into two sides,
<span class='sc'>Romans</span> and <span class='sc'>Carthaginians</span>, the boys being set
one against another as rivals. When lessons are
asked, the rivals are asked in pairs, and each tries
to correct the other. A successful correction is
called a <span class='sc'>Victory</span>. At the end of the half-term
these victories are counted: the side which has the
greater total is freed some afternoon for a <span class='sc'>Victory-walk</span>.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Vile-child</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Eton).—I am informed that this expression
was only used by a particular tutor, and
was never regarded as <i>peculiar</i> to Eton phraseology.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Vill</b>, <i>subs.</i> (Felsted).—The village of Felsted.</p>

<p class='c020'><b>Vish</b>, <i>adj.</i> (Christ’s Hospital).—Cross: the modern

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

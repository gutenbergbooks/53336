                                PREFACE


It has been a matter of note and, maybe, of surprise that no attempt
has hitherto been made to gather in one volume the numerous Words,
Phrases, and Turns of Expression peculiar to OUR GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Bare lists of a dozen or more examples may be found in certain (mostly
out-of-date) Records and Histories; but taking the Schools
individually, only in one instance—Winchester—has there been anything
but the most perfunctory attention given to the subject; and in no
case has the question received that analytical, scientific
treatment—historically and comparatively—which has proved so
invaluable in the “Oxford Dictionary” and in “Slang and its
Analogues.”

It would, however, seem almost necessary to emphasise the fact that this
Word-Book is not, _per se_, a dictionary of school slang. On the
contrary, it is far more than that. For, though such colloquialisms as
are _peculiar_ to Public School life are naturally and rightly included,
yet by far the larger number of the examples here set down do not, by
any accepted method of classification, fall within that category. I am
led to make this clear at the outset by reason of a somewhat curious,
but altogether erroneous idea that the present book was to be a mere
reprint of extracts from the larger work on which, for many years, I
have been engaged. That is not so.

Nor, moreover, do these words and phrases appear, save in very few
instances, in any other work—not even in so admirably complete a
dictionary, in other respects, as “The Century,” while the monumental
Oxford undertaking will not be available, as a complete authority, for
many years to come.

Having thus stated what this work is _not_, it seems borne on me to
explain, anew, what it _is_, or rather, what has been my method. Briefly
put, my idea has been to collect such words, phrases, names, and
allusions to customs as now are, or have been, _peculiar_ to English
Public School life, and to apply to their definition and elucidation
what is known as the “historical” method, illustrating such examples as
lent themselves to it by quotations from old and present-day writers.

The Public Schools with which I have been concerned, arranged
chronologically in order of foundation or charter, are as follows:—

        1160 Derby.                   │1564 Felsted.
        1387 Winchester.              │1567 Rugby.
        1441 Eton.                    │1571 Harrow.
        1515 Manchester Grammar.      │1592 Stonyhurst.
        1538 Royal High School, Edin. │1611 Charterhouse.
        1541 Durham Grammar.          │1619 Dulwich.
        1550 Sherborne.               │1830 Loretto.
        1551 Shrewsbury.              │1841 Cheltenham.
        1552 Christ’s Hospital.       │1843 Marlborough.
        1552 King Edward’s.           │1848 Lancing.
        1553 Tonbridge.               │1859 Wellington.
        1560 Westminster.             │1875 The Leys.
          Also the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham,
                         Aberdeen, Dublin, &c.

How far I have been successful in my task I leave others to judge. I
must confess, however, that the extent and wealth of this special field
of inquiry has somewhat astonished me: yet I fear my lists are, in some
cases, still incomplete. But, even so, this contribution towards a more
perfect glossary will, I think, be a revelation to many.

No wonder our Mother-tongue is so vigorous, adaptable, and
expansive—reaching out in its creative energy to all the forms and
necessities of modern life—when even Young England shows such aptitude
in coining new expressions, and adapting older forms to its
ever-changing (and, shall I say, ever-increasing) needs. Studied
comparatively, there will be found much significance, not alone in the
survivals from past generations, but also in the relatively newer
phraseology. Many an interesting side-light, too, is thrown on ancient
school customs and usages.

Though primarily addressing myself to past schoolmen, it is not without
a hope that the general student and scholar, as well as those still _in
statu pupillari_, will find something of use and to interest.

Finally, I desire, though holding myself alone responsible for aught
that is solecismal in these pages, to acknowledge my indebtedness to
those who have afforded me such unstinted aid in compiling this work.
Especially are my thanks due to Mr. P. K. Tollit (Derby); Mr. W.
Durnford (Eton); Mr. R. D. Hodgson (Manchester Grammar); Mr. C. A. Ross
(Royal High School, Edin.); Rev. A. E. Hillard (Durham); Mr. W. B.
Wildman (Sherborne); Rev. J. F. Cornish (Christ’s Hospital); Rev. E. W.
Badger (King Edward’s, Birm.); Mr. C. H. Crofts (Tonbridge); Rev. E.
Gepp (Felsted); Mr. G. Townsend Warner (Harrow); the Rev. Fathers Gerard
and Browne and Rev. A. Goodier (Stonyhurst); Dr. H. H. Almond (Loretto);
Mr. J. F. L. Hardy (Marlborough); Mr. J. C. Isard (The Leys).

                                  THE
                        PUBLIC SCHOOL WORD-BOOK






*A*, TO GET ONE’S “A,” _verb. phr._ (Harrow).—To pass a certain
    standard in the Gymnasium: the next step being to the
    Gymnasium Eight. _See_ Appendix.


*Abber*, _subs._ (Harrow).—1. An abstract: on history, &c.; set
    as a punishment.

    2. An ABSIT (_q.v._): on whole holidays, or under medical
    advice.


*Abroad*, _adv._ (Winchester).—Convalescent; out of the
    sick-room: _e.g._ “I have been (or come) ABROAD a week.”
    _Cf._ CONTINENT.

  1534. UDALL, _Roister Doister_, ... I bid him keepe warme at home, For
  if he come ABROADE, he shall cough me a mome.

  1598. SHAKSPEARE, 2 _Hen. IV._, i. 2. I am glad to see your Lordship
  ABROAD. I heard say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your Lordship goes
  ABROAD by aduice.

  1761. _Letter_ [WRENCH]. I have been exceeding ill ... am not just got
  ABROAD again.


*Abs*, _adj._ (Winchester).—Absent: placed against the name when
    away from school. [From _absunt_ on Rolls.]

    _Verb._ To take (get, or go) away. Formerly (_circa_ 1840)
    to ABS a tolly (candle) = to put it out; it now = to take it
    away whether lighted or unlighted, the modern NOTION
    (_q.v._) for putting it out being to “dump” it. As a neuter
    verb ABS is generally used in the imperative: _e.g._ “ABS!”
    “Oh, do ABS!” Sometimes, however, a fellow is said TO ABS
    quickly, and MESS THINGS (_q.v._) are ABSED, or put away. To
    HAVE ONE’S WIND ABSED = to have it taken away by a violent
    blow in the stomach.


*Absence*, _subs._ (Eton).—Names-calling. [This takes place at 3
    and 6 P.M. on half-holidays; at 11.30, 3, and 6 P.M. on
    whole-holidays; at 6 P.M. only in summer half.]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 174. And the elevens were made
  up, as they best might, out of such adventurous spirits as dared to
  “skip” roll-calls and ABSENCE for the purpose. Eton, when the losers,
  attributed the fact to the want of their best men in consequence of
  these difficulties.


*Absit*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—_See_ quot.

  1886. DICKENS’S _Dictionary of the University of Cambridge_, p. 3.
  Every undergraduate wishing to leave Cambridge for a whole day, not
  including a night, must obtain an ABSIT from his tutor. Permission to
  go away for a longer period, either at the end of the term or in the
  middle, is called an “exeat,” and no undergraduate should go down
  without obtaining his “exeat.”


*Academia*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—_See_ Appendix.


*Academy*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—An exhibition given at the end
    of every quarter: the first by RHETORIC (_q.v._), the second
    by POETRY (_q.v._), the third by SYNTAX (_q.v._), the last,
    called the GREAT ACADEMIES, by all three combined. This last
    is the crowning act of the school year, being attended by
    many visitors, and is followed by the annual distribution of
    prizes. Hence ACADEMY ROOM = the large hall in which the
    chief exhibitions, displays, concerts, plays, &c., are held.
    [The name may have come from the school at Liège, which was
    known as the “Academy”; but more probably it is of much
    older date, being derived from the “Academiæ” of the _Ratio
    Studiorum Societatis Jesu_.]


*Accidence* (Harrow).—_See_ UPPER SCHOOL.


*Ack* (or *Ick*), _intj._ (Christ’s Hospital).—No! nothing.
    _Ex._ “Lend me your book.” “ACK!” Obsolete.


*Action*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.: obsolete).—A game
    in which a number of boys start from one end of the
    cloisters and run to the other, trying to avoid being
    captured _en route_ by others who seek to intercept
    them. The game was also called FOX AND DOWDY. These were
    names in use twenty-five years ago. To-day the same game
    is called BACCA, because the prisoners must be held long
    enough for the captor to say, “one, two, three, caught,
    tobacco!”


*Ad lib.*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—The time when boys are not
    bound to study in the STUDY-PLACE (_q.v._).


*Admonishing-money*, _subs._ (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 116. The punishments for
  speaking English in hall or school, which have been before alluded to,
  were strictly enforced in his [Dr. Busby’s] days in the way of fines,
  called ADMONISHING-MONEY, which figure occasionally in his [Lynn’s]
  account. The custom was for the second boy of the second election to
  act as a sort of monitor for this purpose, and to deliver to any boy
  who so offended a “mark” or tally, with the words, _Tu es custos_;
  this mark he had to pass in turn to the first whom he could detect in
  a similar slip, and the boy with whom the mark remained when hall
  broke up incurred a fine. Charles Dryden, son of the poet, thought
  himself so hardly used by being made _custos_ three days running (by
  some unfairness, as he conceived), that the father wrote a strong
  letter on the subject to his old master, Busby, and was very nearly
  removing the boy from school.


*Ad portas*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A Latin speech
    delivered by the Senior College Prefect to the Warden of New
    College and the POSERS (_q.v._) under Middle gate at the
    commencement of Election week.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 61. When the Warden of New
  College, Oxford, with two of his Fellows, called the “posers” (or at
  one time “supervisors”), arrive at the college, ... they are received
  with a Latin oration AD PORTAS by the senior scholar. Two other
  speeches are delivered in school just before their arrival: 1.
  _Elizabethæ et Jacobi Laudes_ (commonly known as “Elizabeth and
  Jacob”), by the Prefect of School; 2. _Fundatoris Laudes_, formerly
  assigned to the senior “Founder’s kin” scholar, but now spoken by the
  third prefect.


*Adsum*, _intj._ (Charterhouse).—The response made in answer to
    names-calling.

  1855. THACKERAY, _The Newcomes_, p. 774. At the usual evening hour the
  chapel bell began to toll, and Thomas Newcome’s hands outside the bed
  feebly beat time. And just as the last bell struck a peculiar sweet
  smile shone over his face, and he lifted up his head a little and
  quickly said ADSUM, and fell back. It was the word we used at school
  when names were called; and lo, he whose heart was as that of a little
  child had answered to his name, and stood in the presence of the
  Master.

  1900. _Daily Telegraph_, 23rd March, 8. 7. As in the old days of
  Colonel Newcome, “ADSUM,” or “Always ready,” is still the watch-word
  of the Charterhouse, whose authorities have issued a neatly-printed
  list of Old Carthusians serving in South Africa, in a cover of the
  school colours.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, p. 97. ADSUM is the name of a new
  institution.... There was no occasion for it when the school was in
  London, and none could pass beyond the school precincts. Colonel
  Newcome must have answered ADSUM at prayers only.


*Æger*. _See_ ÆGROTAT.


*Æger-room*, _subs._ (Felsted).—The sick-room. _See_ ÆGROTAT.


*Ægrotat* (or *Æger*), _subs._ (University).—(1) A medical
    certificate excusing attendance. (2) The degree taken by
    those so excused. READING ÆGROTAT = leave taken (generally
    in December) to read for one’s degree. [Lat. _ægrotare_.]

  1794. _Gent. Mag._, p. 1085. They [at Cambridge] sported an ÆGROTAT,
  and they sported a new coat!

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iv. “That there’s the ‘All, sir,
  _that_ is,—where you dines, sir, leastways when you ain’t ‘Æger,’ or
  elseweer.” _Ibid._, viii.—“Not very well, Robert, thank you. I—my head
  aches, and I’m afraid I shall not be able to get up for chapel.”...
  “If you’ll leave it to me, sir, I’ll make it all right for you, _I_
  will. Of course you’d like to take out an ÆGER, sir; and I can bring
  you your Commons just the same.”

  1864. BABBAGE, _Passages from the Life of a Philosopher_, 37. I sent
  my servant to the apothecary for a thing called an ÆGROTAT, which I
  understood ... meant a certificate that I was indisposed.

  1870. _Chambers’s Journal_, June 18, p. 395. Dick laughed. “I’ll get
  the receipt from him. I often want a good thing for an ÆGER.”

  1888. H. SMART, in _Temple Bar_, February, p. 213. “Instead of
  applying for leave to my tutor, I had resorted to the old device of
  pricking ÆGER.”

  1890. _Felstedian_, Feb., p. 2. What’s up ... with Smith? He went ÆGER
  before school this afternoon. I expect he’s rather bad; he is not the
  fellow to go ÆGER for nothing. I do hate that ÆGER-room.


*After Four.* _See_ FOUR.


*Afternoon-tea*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—Detention
    after 3 o’clock.


*After Twelve.* _See_ TWELVE.


*-agger*, _inseparable suffix_ (Charterhouse).—As in
    COMBINAGGERS, a combination suit of pyjamas.


*Alderman*, _subs._ (Felsted: obsolete).—A qualified swimmer.
    [From “The Alders,” a deep pool in the river Chelmer.]

  1893. _Felstedian_, June, p. 79. Years ago there existed at Felsted a
  class of beings known as “Swimming ALDERMEN.” What they were, and
  whence they came, I know not; perhaps some Old Felstedian will be able
  to enlighten me on the point. Perhaps the name was given to those who
  could swim so many times from the “Alders” to “Duck-pond”; or,
  perhaps, the name was derived from the aldermanic proportions of the
  swimmer. _Ibid._ (1895, Ap., p. 44). A fourth term, “ALDERMAN,” was
  not in the list. It has certainly “been dead lengthy” but was once
  prized by its possessors, who had to swim so many times from the “Duck
  Pond” to “The Alders” before they could gain the title. Ten lengths of
  the new bath would afford a fair test, and ALDERMEN might have some
  privilege or other. Its revival would be a good thing, for there has
  of late been a tendency to prefer diving to swimming.


*All.* _See_ ALONG; IN; OUT; and ON.


*Allows*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The weekly allowance of 2s., from
    which breakages, &c., are stopped.


*Alma Mater*, _subs._ (general).—One’s school, college, or
    university.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, ii. 2. A white tie and a pair of very
  small bands—the two articles which, with the usual academicals, form
  the costume demanded by ALMA MATER of all her children when they take
  their places in her schools.

  1874. _The Blue_, Aug., _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_. In fact, the
  musical arrangements of our ALMA MATER were something exceedingly
  below _par_.


*Along.* ALL ALONG, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A kind
    of dribbling football practice: indulged in during a short
    spell of recreation.


*Alto-cad*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The paid member of the choir
    taking alto.


*Amen-chapel*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A long service performed on
    the four days set apart for commemorating the Founder, and
    on the anniversary of his death.


*Ancient-mariner*, _subs._ (University).—A rowing Don.


*Anstey’s.* _See_ PLANKS.


*Apostles*, _subs._ (University).—_See_ quot.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantab._ The APOSTLES are the clodhoppers of
  literature, who have at last scrambled through the Senate House
  without being plucked, and have obtained the title of B.A. by a
  miracle. The last twelve names on the list of Bachelor of Arts are
  thus designated. [The term is now (1900) applied to the last twelve in
  the Mathematical TRIPOS (_q.v._)]


*Appii* (The), _subs._ (Durham: obsolete).—The Three Tuns, a
    celebrated Durham inn. [From a misunderstanding of Acts
    xxviii. 15.]


*Apple-pie Day*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The day on which
    SIX-AND-SIX (_q.v._) is played—the Thursday after the first
    Tuesday in December. [Because hot apple-pies were served on
    GOMERS (_q.v._) in College for dinner.]


*Aquatics*, _subs._ (Eton).—Where boys “in the boats” play
    cricket; also the WET-BOB cricket team.


*Archdeacon*, _subs._ (Oxford).—Merton strong ale.


*Armoury, The* (Harrow).—The room under the Old Schools where
    rifles, belonging to the Rifle Corps, are kept.


*Arrow*, subs. (Harrow).—A challenge arrow, of silver: given to
    the COCK-HOUSE (_q.v._) at shooting.


*Arundel Day* (The Leys).—The choir summer holiday.


*Ascension-day.* _See_ ASCENSIO SCHOLARUM.


*Ascensio Scholarum*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—The opening
    ceremony of the school year. The whole house assembles in
    the STUDY-PLACE (_q.v._), and the Prefect of Studies reads
    out the new forms, prefixing the formula “_Maneant in_” or
    “_Ascendant in_” as the case may be. The day is known as
    “Ascension Day.”

  1843. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Nov. 1883, p. 232. The _Ascensio Scholarum_
  was managed quite otherwise then than now [1843-83].... _Ascension
  Day._—The opening day of schools. Mass of the Holy Ghost is said in
  the church, after breakfast. The different schools, headed by their
  masters, then return to the schoolrooms which they occupied the
  preceding scholastic year. Presently the large bell tolls, and then
  the Prefect of Studies opens the door of POETRY (_q.v._), and
  announces that “RHETORIC (_q.v._) is empty.” The POETS (_q.v._) leave
  their room and ascend to Rhetoric, and forthwith become Rhetoricians,
  with all their privileges. Then the (late) Poet’s doorkeeper knocks at
  SYNTAX’ (_q.v._) door and sings out that “Poetry is empty”; and so on
  through the different schools. The little fellows newly arrived have
  to wait in the gallery until “LITTLE FIGURES” (_q.v._) is vacant, when
  they become Little Figuricians, “Little Figures,” it will be observed,
  being what we [1883] call “ELEMENTS” (_q.v._).


*Ash-planting*, _subs._ (Rugby).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 349. In this room
  [Over-School] it was that, in the latter half of the last century, the
  punishment of ASH-PLANTING used to take place. It was inflicted by
  order and in the presence of a judicial committee of the præposters
  (Sixth Form) for some few grave offences against the recognised
  internal discipline of the school, _e.g._ personal assault upon one of
  their body by a mutinous fag—an offence which would still be severely
  punished by the masters, if not by the Sixth themselves. Three
  ash-saplings were used; in theory, at least, the two first were to be
  broken upon the person of the culprit. The punishment was
  severe—perhaps unjustifiably so; but it had the character of being
  only inflicted in extreme cases, and with strict justice, and was not
  regarded as a cruelty in the school.


*Athens* (Eton).—A bathing-place.

  1865. _Etoniana_, p. 162. No boy is now allowed to go into a boat
  until he has passed an examination in swimming before a committee of
  masters at ATHENS or at Cuckoo Weir.


*Audit-ale* (or *Audit*), _subs._ (Cambridge).—A special brew of
    ale, peculiar to Trinity College. [First-made draught on
    AUDIT days.]

  1837. BARHAM, _Ingoldsby Legends_, “Lay of St. Dunstan.” The “Trinity
  AUDIT ALE” is not come-at-able, as I’ve found to my great grief when
  dining at that table.

  1876. TREVELYAN, _Life of Macaulay_ (1884), ch. iv. p. 127. A glass of
  the AUDIT ALE, which reminded him that he was still a Fellow of
  Trinity.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 55. A lot of Freshmen got together
  after Hall (it was a Saints’ day, and they’d been drinking AUDIT) and
  went and made hay in Marling’s rooms.


*Aul. præ*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Prefect of Hall. [Abbreviation
    of _Præfectus Aulæ_.]


*Ave Maria Lane* (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A walk in the
    playground.






*B*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A standard in Gymnasium the next below
    the A (_q.v._). _See_ Appendix.


*Bacca.* _See_ ACTION.


*Bacchus*, _subs._ (Eton).—A copy of verses. _See_ quot.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 27. On Shrove-Tuesday verses were written [_c._
  1561] in honour or dispraise of Bacchus—“because poets were considered
  the clients of Bacchus”—and those composed by the senior boys were
  fixed on the inside of the folding-doors of the hall, as was the old
  fashion in all schools and colleges. This custom was continued almost
  into modern days, and though the subject was changed, the copy of
  verses was still called “a BACCHUS.” When Pepys paid a visit to the
  school in 1665, he found the subject given out for that year was the
  one topic of absorbing interest—the Plague.


*Back.* To BACK UP, _verb_ (Winchester).—To call out: _e.g._
    “Why didn’t you BACK UP? I should have come.” [In College
    various times are BACKED-UP by Junior in Chambers, such as
    “Three quarters!” “Hour!” “Bells go single!” “Bells down!”]


*Back Alley* (The Leys: obsolete).—A passage dividing “Upper”
    and “Lower” Quadrangle: now done away with.


*Backings-up*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Half-burned fagot-ends.
    [BACKING (prov. in Linc., Leices., and North country) =
    slack; small-coal; turf.]


*Backs*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A favourite walk with
    undergraduates.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 23. I’m in training now for the
  Lent races, and have to be out for a walk in the BACKS before
  breakfast every morning.


*Badger*, _subs._ (Wellington).—A member of the Second XV. at
    football. [A “badge” is bestowed when permission is given to
    play in this team.]


*Bag*, _subs._ (Westminster).—Milk.


*Bags* (or *Bags I*), _intj._ (common).—Used to assert a claim
    to some article or privilege. Analogous school slang is
    FAINS or FAIN IT (_q.v._) for demanding a truce during the
    progress of a game, and which is always granted by the
    opposing party. In other schools PIKE I or PRIOR PIKE serve
    to lay claim to anything, or for asserting priority. Also
    BAR: _e.g._ “He wanted me to do so and so, but I BARRED
    not.” _Cf._ FAIN.


*Bags’-stile*, _subs._ (Rugby).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 363. On the Dunchurch Road there
  was a stile long known as BAGS’ STILE; here a certain set of boys, of
  whom Lyttelton was one [_c._ 1793], used to sit and “chaff” the
  passing “bagsmen”—for the commercial travellers to Rugby then rode
  with actual saddle-bags; and this practice led to terrible fights
  occasionally with the aggrieved riders.


*Bake*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To rest; to sit or lie at ease.
    Hence BAKER (_q.v._); BAKESTER (obsolete) = a sluggard;
    BAKING-LEAVE (_q.v._); BAKING-PLACE (_q.v._); BAKER-LAYER
    (_q.v._). [North. Dial. _beak_ = to bask in the heat.
    JAMIESON, _beik_, _beke_, _beek_ = to bask.]

  1360. _Ywaine_ [RITSON, _E. M. R._]. And ligges BEKEAND in his bed.

  _d._ 1395. _Barbour MS._ Ane Inglis man, that lay BEKAND Hym be a fyr.

  1577. KENDALL [WRENCH]. At home we take our ease And BEAKE ourselves
  in rest.

  1648. SYMMONS, _Vindication of Chas. I._ Wherefore if that Pope of
  Rome when he lay BEAKING himself in the midst of his luxuries, had
  cause to cry out, _Heu quantum patimur pro Christo_.

  _d._ 1758. RAMSAY, _Works_. She and her cat sit BEEKING in her yard.


*Baker*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A cushion; also anything used
    to sit or kneel upon, as a blotting-book, &c. [BAKERS were
    of two kinds: that used in “College” was of large size,
    oblong in shape, and green in colour. The other, used in
    “Commoners,” was thin, narrow, much smaller, and of red
    colour.] Hence BAKER-LAYER (obsolete) = a Junior who used
    to take a Prefect’s green BAKER in and out of Hall at
    meal-times.


*Baker-layer.* _See_ BAKER.


*Baking-leave*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—1. Permission to
    BAKE (_q.v._) in a study in Commoners, or in a SCOB (_q.v._)
    place in College. 2. Leave to sit in another’s TOYS
    (_q.v._).


*Baking-place*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Any place in which to BAKE
    (_q.v._), or in connection with which BAKING-LEAVE (_q.v._)
    was given.


*Balbus*, _subs._ (University).—A Latin prose composition. [From
    the frequency with which BALBUS is quoted in ARNOLD’S
    well-known text-book, _Latin Prose Composition_.]

  1870. _Quarterly Review._ BALBUS was in constant use.


*Ball.* CALL THE BALL! _phr._ (Stonyhurst).—The “Foul!” of
    Association Football.


*Balls*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A Junior in College collects
    footballs from the lockers in school and takes them through
    at 6 o’clock to the Ball-keeper in Commoners to be blown or
    repaired. The Ball-keeper is an Inferior who, for service in
    looking after cricket and foot-balls, is exempted from
    KICKING-IN (_q.v._) and WATCHING-OUT (_q.v._).


*Bally*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete).—Ball court, the old name
    for the Fives’ courts; there was a game, evidently like
    fives, played at Sherborne against the north transept of the
    church as early as 1585. The word has long ago passed out of
    use.


*Banco*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Evening preparation at HOUSE
    under the superintendence of a monitor; the Winchester
    TOY-TIME (_q.v._).

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 81. At old Charterhouse monitors had
  unlimited powers.... They were seldom interfered with by any master;
  for instance, the visit of a house master to BANCO was intensely
  resented. There was a “boule” in the Sixth Form of 1872, as to what a
  monitor should do who was thus insulted. Should he at once put his cap
  on, and take no notice of the master? or would it be more dignified to
  walk straight out of the room? _Ibid._, 84. The chief duties of a
  monitor now are to keep BANCO, and to see that order is preserved in
  the cubicles, and in his house generally. BANCO is the time from 7.30
  to 8.55 every week-day evening except Saturday, and from 8.15 to 8.55
  on Sundays, when the Under School sit in Long Room and prepare their
  work for the next day. The keeping of BANCO is a fine exercise in
  discipline for the monitor, and a very convenient arrangement for the
  house master. It is a tradition that a monitor helps every Under
  School boy with his work during BANCO if he can. _Ibid._, 95. The term
  BANCO was suggested by H. W. Phillott, afterwards Canon of Hereford
  ... in 1832, or a little later.


*Bandy*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: nearly obsolete).—The Stonyhurst
    form of Hockey: prominent in the Tichborne trial, when the
    Claimant at first thought it a nickname, and afterwards a
    part of the College buildings.

  1823. NARES, _Glossary_, s.v. BANDY-BALL. A Yorkshire game, played
  with a crooked bat and a ball. It is the same as the Scottish game of
  golf. See STOWE’S _Survey_, ed. 1720, i. 251.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. BANDY. A game played with
  sticks called BANDIES, bent and round at one end, and a small wooden
  ball, which each party endeavours to drive to opposite fixed points.
  Northbrooke, in 1577, mentions it as a favourite game in Devonshire.
  It is sometimes called BANDY-BALL, and an early drawing of the game is
  copied in STRUTT’S _Sports and Pastimes_, p. 102.


*Bangy* (or *Bangay*), _subs._ (Winchester).—Brown sugar. Also
    as _adj._ = brown. Hence BANGAY BAGS (or BANGIES) =
    brown-coloured trousers. WRENCH says the strong objection to
    these in former times probably arose from Tony Lumpkin
    coming to school in corduroys. [Suggested derivations are:
    (1) from _Bangalore_, a coarse-sugar growing country; (2)
    _bhang_ = hemp; (3) _banjy_ (Essex) = dull, gloomy.] A brown
    gate formerly leading from Grass Court into Sick House Meads
    was known as the BANGY GATE. The term is now often applied
    to the gate by Racquet Court into Kingsgate Street.


*Bar.* TO BAR OUT, _verb. phr._ (Royal High School, Edin.:
    obsolete).—To lock or barricade the doors to exclude the
    masters. This custom has been practically extinct since the
    day that Bailie John Macmorrane was shot by a pupil, William
    Sinclair, son of the Chancellor of Caithness, while
    endeavouring to get the door battered down (Sept. 15, 1595).


*Barbar*, _subs._ (Durham).—A candidate for scholarship from
    another school. [That is, “barbarian” = foreigner.]


*Barber*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A thick fagot or bough; one was
    included in each bundle. Also any large piece of wood.

    _Verb_ (University).—To work off impositions by deputy.
    [Tradition relates that a learned barber was at one time
    frequently employed as a scapegoat in working off this
    species of punishment inflicted on peccant students.] Also
    TO BARBERISE.

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_, xii. As for
  impositions, why ... ’Aint there coves to BARBERISE ’em for you?


*Barge*, _subs._ (Sherborne).—Small cricket: played, with a
    stump for bat, against a wall.

    _Verb_ (Charterhouse).—To hustle; TO MOB UP (_q.v._); TO
    BRICK (_q.v._).


*Barn, The* (Charterhouse).—A temporary wooden building,
    constructed in 1876 to meet deficiencies in class-room
    accommodation. It stood on the site now occupied by the
    Museum. It disappeared in 1884.


*Barnet*, _intj._ (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—Nonsense!
    Humbug!


*Barn-school*, _subs._ (Rugby).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 367. Dr. James found there [Rugby
  in 1777] 52 boys; in five years he had raised them to 165. The one
  large schoolroom was no longer sufficient ... a new building was
  added.... Even the new schools overflowed, for the members rose in
  time to near 300; and the head-master was obliged to migrate into a
  barn adjoining the Dunchurch Road.... There for more than twenty years
  successive head-masters taught the two senior forms.... Connecting
  these buildings with the three schools adjoining the old manor-house
  was a line of cow-sheds, which served as a shelter in rainy
  weather.... Such was the Rugby of 1809; for it was not till long
  afterwards that barn and cow-sheds disappeared, though the present
  school buildings were begun in that year.


*Barracks*, _subs._ (Loretto).—A Form occasionally interpolated
    between NIPPERS (_q.v._) and Fourth. [In the Sixties a
    master at Loretto was known as the Captain, and when the
    first overflow from the school-house took place, the
    house in which a few boys slept, and over which he was
    master, was called the Garrison. The adjoining house was
    afterwards occupied and was called the BARRACKS. Whence the
    interpolated Form, which for a time had for its schoolroom a
    room at that house, getting the name of the Barracks Form.
    The name clung to it when moved to one of the regular
    schoolrooms.]


*Barter*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A half volley at cricket. Also
    as _verb_. [From Warden Barter, who was famous in the
    cricket-field for dealing with such balls.]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 65. None showed more enthusiastic
  interest in these [Public School Cricket] matches than the late
  excellent Warden, Robert Speckott Barter.... He seldom missed a match
  at Lord’s from the time he played in the school eleven himself. He was
  a tremendous hitter in his day; and the remarkable punishment which he
  dealt out to the ball, when he was lucky enough to catch it on the
  “half-volley,” has given to a long hit of this character at Winchester
  (and even elsewhere) the name of a BARTER.


*Bartlemytide*, _subs._ (general: old).—The summer holiday.


*Base*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A goal: at football.


*Basinite*, _subs._ (Charterhouse: obsolete).—A hot-water fag:
    he had to get hot water and towels ready for a monitor when
    he descended to wash in COCKS (_q.v._).


*Bat-mugger*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A wooden instrument used in
    oiling cricket-bats.


*Battal*, _subs._ (Harrow and Charterhouse).—Battalion drill for
    the Rifle Corps: usually (at Harrow) in the evening. [The
    second is the syllable accentuated.]


*Battler*, _subs._ (general).—A student. _See_ BATTLINGS.


*Battlings* (or *Battels*), _subs._ (general).—An allowance, in
    money or kind; apparently originally intended to supplement
    the meagre fare of fast-days. _Cf._ quots. Hence TO BATTEL =
    to take provisions from the buttery.

  1607. WENTWORTH SMITH, _Puritan_ [MALONE, _Suppl._, ii. 543]. Eat my
  commons with a good stomach, and BATTLED with discretion.

  1611. COTGRAVE, _Dict._... To BATTLE (as scholars do in Oxford), être
  debiteur au collège pour ses vivres. _Ibid._, Mot usé seulement des
  jeunes écoliers de l’université d’Oxford.

  16 [?]. _Account rendered to Arch. of York_ [_William of Wykeham and
  His Colleges_]. Item for BATTLINGS on fasting days with the lent. 0.
  9. 8. [_i.e._, 9s. 8d.]

  1678. PHILLIPS, _Dict._, s.v. BATTEL. In the University of Oxford is
  taken for to run on to exceedings above the ordinary stint of the
  appointed Commons.

  1744. SALMON, _Present State of Univ._, i. 423. Undergraduates
  consisting of Noblemen, Gentlemen-Commoners, Commoners, Scholars of
  the Foundation, Exhibitioners, BATTLERS, and Servitors.... The
  Commoners, I presume, are so called from their Commoning together, and
  having a certain portion of Meat and Drink provided for them,
  denominated Commons.... The BATTLERS are entitled to no Commons, but
  purchase their Meat and Drink of the Cook and Butler.

  1786-1805. TOOKE, _Purley_, 390, _s.v._ BATTEL, a term used at Eton
  for the small portion of food which, in addition to the College
  allowance, the Collegers receive from the Dames.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 184. The
  expense was defrayed by the boys subscribing the last three BATTLINGS
  (_i.e._ the weekly shilling allowed each boy). This was rather an
  illusory coin, for we seldom actually fingered it, as some one of the
  College servants generally had a kind of prescriptive right to a
  benefit; and whenever Saturday arrived, Præfect of Hall’s valet was
  sure to come round to ask the boys if they would give their BATTLING
  to Rat Williams, or Dungy, or Pulver, or Long John, or some other
  equally deserving individual.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, II. vii. [Note]. BATTELS are the
  accounts of the expenses of each student. It is stated in Todd’s
  _Johnson_ that this singular word is derived from the Saxon verb,
  meaning “to count or reckon.” But it is stated in the _Gentleman’s
  Magazine_ for 1792, that the word may probably be derived from the
  Low-German word _bettahlen_, “to pay,” whence may come our English
  word _tale_ or _score_.

  1864. _Household Words_, p. 188. The business of the latter was to
  call us of a morning to distribute amongst us our BATTLINGS, or
  pocket-money.

  1880. TROLLOPE, _Autobiogr._, i. 13. Every boy had a shilling a week
  pocket-money, which we called BATTELS. [This is probably a
  misprint—the Winchester term, as that used at other schools, is
  BATTLING. It was advanced out of the pocket of the Second Master.]

  1886-87. DICKENS, _Dictionary of Oxford and Cambridge_, p. 16. BATTELS
  is properly a designation of the food obtained from the College
  Buttery. An account of this, and of the account due to the Kitchen, is
  sent in to every undergraduate weekly, hence these bills also are
  known as BATTELS, and the name, further, is extended to the total
  amount of the term’s expenses furnished by the College. In some
  Colleges it is made essential to the keeping of an undergraduates’
  term that he should BATTEL, _i.e._ obtain food in College on a certain
  number of days each week.

  1889. MURRAY, _Hist. Eng. Dict._, s.v. BATTELS. Much depends on the
  original sense at Oxford: if this was ‘food, provisions,’ it is
  natural to connect it with “BATTLE,” to feed, or receive
  nourishment.... It appears that the word has apparently undergone
  progressive extensions of application, owing partly to changes in the
  internal economy of the colleges. Some Oxford men of a previous
  generation state that it was understood by them to apply to the
  buttery accounts alone, or even to the provisions ordered from the
  buttery, as distinct from the “commons” supplied from the kitchen; but
  this latter use is disavowed by others, ... but whether the BATTELS
  were originally the provisions themselves, or the sums due on account
  of them, must at present be left undecided.


*Baulk*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A false report. This is SPORTED
    (_q.v._), not spread.


*Beak*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A master. FORM-BEAK = Form-master.


*Beanfielder*, _subs._ (Felsted: obsolete).—A long hit: at
    cricket.


*Bearded Cad*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A porter employed by the
    College to convey luggage from the railway station to the
    school. [The term originated in an extremely hirsute
    individual, who, at one time, acted in the capacity.]


*Beards!* _intj._ (The Leys: obsolete).—An ejaculation of
    surprise.


*Beast*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A student who, having left
    school, goes up to Cambridge to study before entering the
    university. [Because (so it is stated) he is neither man
    nor boy.]


*Bedmaker* (or *Bedder*) _subs._ 1. (Cambridge).—A charwoman; a
    servant who makes beds and does other necessary domestic
    duties for residents in College.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 6. Remember me most kindly to Mrs.
  Bloggins. I shall never forget how good she was when we were at
  Cambridge last term.... These BEDMAKERS are kind souls after all.

    2. (Oxford).—BEDDER = a bedroom.


*Beef Row*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 247. The dinners themselves [_c._
  1800-40] were fairly good, with the exception of the “boiled beef”
  days, which were highly unpopular. The beef was probably good enough,
  but it was cured with saltpetre, and the consequent redness was, in
  the boys’ eyes, objectionable. Remonstrances had been made in vain;
  and the result was something like a school rebellion, well remembered
  as the BEEF ROW. By concerted arrangement, on one day the boys in
  every hall rose from the table in a body, and left the masters and the
  boiled beef in sole occupation. Butler was indignant; he came into
  each of the halls after locking up, and demanded from the heads of the
  school a public apology for the insult, giving them an hour for
  consideration, and placing before them the alternative of immediate
  dismissal. The boys held together, and, early the next morning the
  whole of the Sixth Form, comprising no less than three who were to be
  future heads of Colleges, were started by chaise or coach for their
  respective homes. The rest of the boys declared themselves _en
  revolte_; they would not go into school, and the masters walked about
  the court alternately threatening and persuading. At last a gentleman
  in the town, an old Shrewsbury boy, much respected, harangued the
  rebels, and persuaded them to surrender. Some sort of concession seems
  almost to have been made by a portion of the absent Sixth Form under
  home influence, and the affair ended in the return of all the exiles.


*Beeswaxers*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Thick boots for football.
    [Pronounced Bĕswaxers.]


*Behind*, _subs._ (Eton and Winchester).—A back at football.
    At Eton SHORT BEHIND and LONG BEHIND: usually abbreviated
    to “short” and “long.” At Winchester, SECOND BEHIND and
    LAST BEHIND. These answer to the half-back and back of
    Association football. At Winchester, in the Fifteens,
    there is also a THIRD BEHIND.

    UP BEHIND, _phr._ (The Leys).—Out of bounds: at back of
    College.


*Behind one’s Side.* _See_ SIDE.


*Bejant*, _subs._ (Aberdeen).—A new student: one of the first or
    lowest class. _See_ SEMI-BEJANTS, TERTIANS, and MAGISTRANDS.


*Belial*, _subs._ (Oxford).—Balliol College.


*Bells.* BELLS GO SINGLE, _phr._ (Winchester).—A single bell is
    rung for five minutes before the hour at which chapel
    commences. For College evening chapel three three’s are
    rung, and then follows a “bell,” one for every man in
    College—70. BELLS DOWN = _see_ quots.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 62. The
  junior in chamber had a hard time of it; ... while endeavouring to get
  through his multifarious duties, he had to keep a sharp ear on the
  performance of the chapel bell, and to call out accordingly, “first
  peal!” “second peal!” and BELLS DOWN!

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, p. 256. At a quarter to six the peal again
  rang out, and the cry of BELLS GO was sounded in shrill tones through
  every chamber of College and Commoners.... After ten minutes the peal
  changed, and only a single bell continued to ring. This was notified
  by the cry BELLS GO SINGLE, and five minutes afterwards, by that of
  “BELLS DOWN.”... Presently the head-master ... would descend from his
  library: or the second master ... would appear at the archway near
  Sixth Chamber, and the warning voice would be heard “Gabell,” or
  “Williams through,” “Williams,” or “Ridding in.” Straightway there
  would be a general rush, the college-boys darting across the
  quadrangle in the rear of the Præfect of Chapel; while the Commoners
  hurried in, keeping up a continuous stream from their more distant
  quarters.


*Belly-hedge*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury).—An obstruction of
    such a height that it can easily be cleared: of school
    steeplechases. [That is, about belly high.]


*Belows*, _subs._ (Rugby).—_See_ CAP (3).


*Bender*, _subs._ (common).—The bow-shaped segment of a kite.

  1873. Dr. BLACKLEY, _Hay Fever_, p. 145. The first kite was six feet
  in length by three feet in width, and was made of the usual form,
  namely, with a central shaft or “standard,” and a semicircular top or
  BENDER.


*Bene-book*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ quot.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 131. Besides prizes, BENE-BOOKS are awarded
  to the Sixth Forms on the following system: Every boy generally does
  four classical exercises a week, viz., Greek and Latin prose, Greek
  and Latin verse, and one mathematical exercise; these are marked,
  according to their merit, B, b, sb, s, vs, m, M; that is to say, Big
  bene, bene, satis bene, satis, vix satis, male, Big male.... A
  BENE-BOOK (value 12s. 6d.) is earned by the winner of two BENES a week
  throughout the quarter. There used to be a yet higher mark, _i.e._,
  B†, or a WRITE-OUT, which counted four. A B† denoted that the
  composition to which it was attached was worthy of being written out
  in a book kept with a view to forming a new edition of “Sertum
  Carthusianum.” There are many volumes of old WRITE-OUT books on the
  shelves of the library, but for years no addition has been made to
  them. The WRITE-OUT is quite obsolete.


*Bevers*, _subs._ (general).—An afternoon meal or refreshment;
    a snack between meals. Whence (Winchester) BEVERS (or
    BEVER-TIME) = an interval from 4.30 to 5 in afternoon
    school, observed (says WRENCH) long after the distribution
    of bread and beer had ceased on whole school-days. [_See_
    BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, i. 20; FORD, i. 392; FLORIO, in v.
    _Merénda_; COOPER, in v. _Antecænium_; _Stanihurst’s
    Descr. of Ireland_, p. 18; _Nomenclator_, p. 79; Sir JOHN
    OLDCASTLE, p. 42; HOWELL, sect. 43; MIDDLETON’S _Works_,
    iv. 427, v. 141.]

  1580. _Lingua_ [DODSLEY, _Old Plays_ (REID, 1825), v. 148].
  _Appetitus._ Your gallants never sup, breakfast, nor BEVER without me.

  1585. _Nomenclator_, p. 79. A middaies meale: an undermeale: a boire
  or BEAVER: a refreshing betwixt meales.

  1597. HARRISON, _Desc. of England_. Of old we had breakfastes in the
  forenoone, BEUARAGES or nuntions after dinner, and thereto reare
  suppers, generallie when it was time to go to rest, a toie brought
  into England by hardie Canutus; but nowe these are very well past, and
  each one, except some young hungrie stomach, that cannot fast till
  dinner-time, contenteth him self with dinner and supper.

  1598. FLORIO, _Worlde of Wordes_, s.v. Merenda, Plauto. Propriè olim
  prandium dicebatur quod meridie daretur. Nonius cibum qui post
  meridiem sumitur interpretatur. ἑσπέρισμα. Le reciner.

  1604. MARLOWE, _Dr. Faustus_. Thirty meals a day and ten BEVERS.

  1607. BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, _Woman Hater_, i. 3. He is none of those
  same ordinary eaters, that will devour three breakfasts, and as many
  dinners, without any prejudice to their BEVERS, drinkings, or suppers.

  1611. COTGRAVE, _Dict._, s.v. BEVER. An afternoon’s nuncheon.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 83. In
  summer time we were let out of afternoon school for a short time about
  4 P.M., when there was a slight refection of bread and cheese laid out
  in Hall. It was called BEEVER-TIME, and the pieces of bread BEEVERS.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. BEVER. An intermediate
  refreshment between breakfast and dinner. The term is now applied to
  the afternoon snack of harvest-men and other labourers, and perhaps
  may be explained more correctly as any refreshment taken between the
  regular meals. Sometimes refreshments of drink, or drinkings, were
  called BEVERS; but potations were not BEVERS, as Mr. Dyce asserts.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_ [Winchester], p. 23. School opened
  again at two o’clock; at half-past three came an interval called
  BEVER-TIME, when the boys had again bread and beer allowed them. At
  five the school was dismissed, and the whole resident society—warden,
  fellows, masters, and scholars—went in procession round the cloisters
  and the whole interior circuit of the college.

  1884. M. MORRIS, in _English Illustrated Magazine_, Nov., p. 73. [At
  Eton, we] came up from cricket in the summer afternoons for BEAVER.


*Bible-Clerk*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A College Prefect in full
    power, appointed for one week. Formerly (with OSTIARIUS,
    _q.v._) he kept order in school, and assisted at floggings.
    He now reads lessons in Chapel, and takes round ROLLS
    (_q.v._). He is absolved from going up to BOOKS (_q.v._)
    during his term of office. The Prefect of HALL need not act
    as BIBLE-CLERK unless he likes, and the Prefect of School
    may choose any week he pleases; the rest take weeks in
    rotation, in the order of their Chambers in College.

  15 [?]. CHRIS. JOHNSON [WRENCH]. In Testamento Veteri caput alter in
  Aulâ Clarâ voce legit, qui BIBLIOCLERICUS inde Dicitur; hebdomadam
  propriis habet ille Camænsis.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 103.
  Order was kept during school hours by the BIBLE-CLERK and Ostiarius,
  two of the Præfects, who held these offices in rotation—the former
  lasting for a week, the latter for one day only. They paraded School
  armed with sticks, and brought up to the Head and Second Masters (who
  alone had the power of flogging) the names of the delinquents which
  had been “ordered” for punishment; the names of the more heinous
  offenders being confided to the BIBLE-CLERK, the others to the
  Ostiarius.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. BIBLE. A great book. (_A.-N._)
  The term was constantly used without any reference to the Scriptures.
  _Ibid._, s.v. BIBLE-CLERKSHIP. A very ancient scholarship in the
  Universities, so called because the student who was promoted to that
  office was enjoined to read the Bible at meal-times.

  1864. _Blackwood’s Magazine_, XCV., p. 73. [At dinner] portions of
  beef were served out to the boys ... the BIBLE-CLERK meanwhile reading
  a chapter from the Old Testament. _Ibid._, p. 87. An hour ... is
  expected to be employed in working under the superintendence of the
  BIBLE-CLERK, as the Præfect in daily “course” is termed, who is
  responsible for a decent amount of order and silence at these hours.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, p. 59. There appears to have been no
  regular BIBLE-CLERK.... From this it has been inferred that the
  institution of these offices must have been subsequent, and (some
  think) long subsequent, to the Founder’s time.


*Bibler.* _See_ BIBLING.


*Bibling* (or *Bibler*), _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A
    flogging of six strokes. Hence BIBLING-ROD = the instrument
    used in BIBLING: it consisted of a handle with four apple
    twigs in the end twisted together. It was first used by
    Warden Baker in 1454, and is represented in the _Aut Disce_.
    BIBLING UNDER NAIL = a BIBLING administered for very heinous
    offences after an offender had stood under NAIL (_q.v._).

  1864. _Blackwood’s Magazine_, XCV., p. 79. Underneath is the place of
  execution, where delinquents are BIBLED. _Ibid._, p. 72. It need
  hardly be said that it [the rod] is applied in the ordinary fashion:
  six cuts forming what is technically called a BIBLING—on which
  occasions the Bible-Clerk introduces the victim; four being the sum of
  a less terrible operation called a “scrubbing.”

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 37. Underneath is the place of
  execution, where delinquents are BIBLED; and near it is a socket for a
  candle-sconce, known as the “nail,” under which any boy who has been
  detected in any disgraceful fault—lying, &c.—is placed as in a sort of
  pillory to await his punishment; a piece of ancient discipline for
  which happily there is seldom occasion.


*Bicker*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—A fray between the
    boys of the school and the town boys, or KEELIES (_q.v._);
    generally waged with the aid of stones (_cf._ GEORGE
    BORROW’S _Lavengro_, ch. vii.; also SCOTT, _Redgauntlet_,
    ch. i.). In the present Rector’s boyhood these school fights
    were often waged with “Cowts,” made of a rope twisted firmly
    into a thick end, with about four feet attached with which
    to swing it.

  ... _Cursor Mundi_, MS. Coll. Trin. Cantab., f. 87. And for she loveth
  me out of BIKER, Of my love she may be siker.

  1581. RICHE, _Farewell to Militarie Profession_. My captaine, feelyng
  suche a BICKERYNG within himself, the like whereof he had never
  indured upon the sea, was like to bee taken prisoner aboard his owne
  shippe.

  1585. _Nomenclator._ Naturæ et morbi conflictus, Aurel. κρίσις. The
  conflict or BICKERMENT of nature and sicknesse.

  1823. NARES, _Glossary_, s.v. BICKERING and BICKERMENT. Skirmishing.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. BICKER. To fight; to quarrel;
  to act with hostility. _Ibid._, BICKERMENT. Conflict. _Ibid._, s.v.
  BIKERE. To skirmish; to fight; to quarrel. Also a substantive, a
  quarrel. (_A.-S._) _Cf._ _Leg. Wom._, 2650; _Piers Ploughman_, p. 429;
  MINOT’S _Poems_, p. 51; _Arthour and Merlin_, p. 206.


*Biddy*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A bath in College. [Fr. _bidet_.]


*Big*, _adj._ (Harrow).—Upwards of sixteen years of age; as
    “only able to go in for BIG sports.” _See_ SMALL.


*Big-game*, _subs._ (Harrow: obsolete).—The chief football game.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 312. There is now a spacious
  piece of ground kept for the especial purpose, where as many as six
  separate games can be played at once, besides four smaller grounds
  belonging to different houses. The BIG-GAME, in which only the _élite_
  of the school players take part, is managed by the monitors under very
  stringent regulations. [Now called Sixth Form game.—ED.]


*Big-school*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—The room in which
    the school assembles for prayers, or on any occasion when it
    is addressed as a whole by the Head Master. The room is also
    used for teaching, though not so entirely so as twenty-five
    years ago.


*Big-side*, _subs._ (Rugby and elsewhere).—The combination of
    all the bigger fellows in the school in one and the same
    game or run. Also the ground specially used for the game so
    denominated. Hence BIG-SIDE run = a paper-chase, in which
    picked representatives of all Houses take part, as opposed
    to a House run. _See_ LITTLE-SIDE.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, vii. “Well, I’m going to have
  a try,” said Tadpole; “it’s the last run of the half, and if a fellow
  gets in at the end, BIG-SIDE stands ale and bread and cheese and a
  bowl of punch; and the Cock’s such a famous place for ale.”


*Bill*, _subs._ 1. (Eton).—A list of the boys who go to the Head
    Master at 12 o’clock; also of those who get off ABSENCE
    (_q.v._): _e.g._ an eleven playing in a match are thus
    exempt. _See_ Appendix.

  c. 1850. BRODRICK, _Memories and Impressions_. ... It is credibly
  reported of Mr. Cookesley—who, in spite of a tendency to buffoonery,
  was an inspiring teacher—that he addressed a remarkably stupid boy in
  the following terms: “I tell you what it is, sir, if you ever show me
  up a copy of your own verses again, I’ll put you in the BILL” (an
  Etonian euphemism for a capital punishment). “Why, a great strong
  fellow like you can have no difficulty in getting a decent copy of
  verses written for him, and if you ever again bring me one of your own
  concoction I’ll have you flogged.”

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 100. Bagshawe even went so far
  as to rebuke one of the monitors for rising in Mr. James’ presence;
  and when told that it was by Mr. Busby’s order, desired him to write
  that down on his BILL; a proceeding equivalent, as Mr. Busby declared,
  and as Westminster and Eton men will perhaps agree, to ordering the
  head-master up for corporal punishment.

  1876. BRINSLEY RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_. Some of the small boys
  whom this delightful youth tempted to ape his habits, had often
  occasion to rue it when they staggered back to College giddy and sick,
  carrying with them a perfume which told its tale to their tutors, and
  caused them to be put in the BILL.

    2. (Harrow).—The “call-over” of the whole school on
    half-holidays; at 4 P.M. in summer, at 4.15 P.M. in other
    terms. Whence BILL-BOOK = the book—the list of the school in
    order of forms—from which BILL is called; BILL-ORDER = the
    order of the school as in the BILL-BOOK; BILL-MONITOR = a
    member of the “First Fourth” who is in charge of the paper
    on which monitors sign their names during BILL. Also used at
    Westminster.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 284. His pupils were chiefly
  boys of rank, and during Thackeray’s time had been exempted from
  appearing at BILLS. Sumner stopped this privilege, to the great
  disgust of Dr. Glasse and some of his aristocratic friends. Earl
  Radnor even threatened to “ruin the school” if Sumner refused to give
  way; but the new head-master was firm. Lord Dartmoor, on the other
  hand, supported him, and removed his sons into his House from
  Glasse’s, who was beaten in the struggle, and left Harrow. _Ibid._,
  293. At the time of his appointment he was only twenty-six, but his
  reputation as a scholar stood very high. It is enough to say that
  under his rule Harrow has increased in numbers, and certainly not lost
  in reputation. The last BILL-BOOK contains 492 names.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 446. The uniformity of daily life
  at Harrow was interrupted by a pleasant interlude not long ago. The
  Chinese Ambassador paid a visit to the school. His Excellency made an
  inspection of the school buildings, and was finally cheered at BILL.


*Bill-brighter*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A small fagot used for
    lighting coal fires in kitchen. [From a servant, Bill
    Bright, who was living in 1830.]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 89. The
  Kitchen is a spacious apartment with a vaulted roof, occupying the
  entire height of the building on the west side of the quadrangle, and
  at least half its length; here we might see a few Fags endeavouring to
  coax Jem Sims, John Coward, or Mother Mariner (the cooks) for an extra
  supply of mashed potatoes, till Kitchen is cleared by the exasperated
  Manciple, who has just detected a delinquent in the act of secreting
  under his gown an armful of the small faggots used for lighting the
  Kitchen fires (called BILL BRIGHTERS), an opportunity for purloining
  which was never allowed to slip by a Junior of a properly regulated
  mind.


*Bim* (or *Bimb*), _verb_ (Tonbridge).—To cane. Hence BIMB-STICK
    = a cane.


*Binge*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A drinking-bout. [_Binger_ (Linc.) =
    tipsy.]


*Birch-broom Race*, _subs. phr._ (Winchester).—_See_ TORCH-RACE.


*Birch-room*, _subs._ (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 178. Behind is the “French
  room,” once known as the BIRCH-ROOM (in which those useful implements
  were manufactured and used), where a bench is carefully preserved
  bearing the name of “John Dryden,” no doubt cut by the poet himself,
  as the style of the letters corresponds with his date.


*Bird*, _subs._ (Durham).—A credulous boy; one easily cajoled; a
    “soft.”


*Bishop*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The sapling with which a fagot
    is bound together.


*Bite*, _intj._ (Charterhouse and Christ’s Hospital).—_Cave!_


*Black*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A nickname.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, I. vi. “There’s plenty of
  youngsters don’t care about it,” said Walker. “Here, here’s Scud
  East—you’ll be tossed, won’t you, young un?” Scud was East’s nickname,
  or BLACK, as we called it, gained by his fleetness of foot.


*Black Book, The* (Charterhouse).—_See_ EXTRA.


*Black-hole*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 241. There used to be a small
  four-square apartment, not much larger than a Punch-and-Judy box,
  lighted by a single narrow loop-hole—a receptacle for the
  flogging-block and other like apparatus. This was known as the
  BLACK-HOLE, or sometimes more familiarly as “Rome’s Hole,” from a
  traditionary culprit who had been a very regular occupant.


*Black-jack*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A large leathern beer jug
    used in College. It holds two gallons. In olden times
    BLACK-JACKS were in common use for small beer. [_See_ UNTON,
    _Inventories_, p. 1; BRAND’S _Pop. Antiq._, ii. 206; _Ord.
    and Reg._, p. 392; HEYWOOD’S _Edward IV._, p. 97. Also JACK:
    whence (Christ’s Hospital) JACK-BOY = a boy servitor of
    beer.]

  _c._ 1844. _Reminiscences of Christ’s Hospital_ (_The Blue_, Aug.
  1874). By mistake the Cask was found to contain a fine old ale. The
  news soon spread from boy to boy and from ward to ward; and there was
  an extraordinary call upon the services of the JACK-BOYS, whose utmost
  exertions were scarcely equal to the demand. As might be expected,
  these latter took care of themselves upon the occasion.


*Black-sheep*, _verb_ (Winchester: obsolete).—To get above (or
    “jockey”) a fellow in Middle Part: of men in Junior Part.


*Black Tiger, The* (Rugby).—A nickname given to Dr. Ingles,
    head-master from 1793 to 1803.


*Blandyke* (Stonyhurst).—The monthly recreation day. [From the
    village of Blandyke (now Blandecques), a league from St.
    Omers, where was a country house or villa at which such days
    were spent during the summer months.] _See_ Appendix.


*Blazer*, _subs._ (originally Cambridge: now general).—A light
    jacket of bright colour. Originally applied to the bright
    red uniform of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of St. John’s
    College, Cambridge. [Prof. SKEAT (_N. and Q._, 7 S., iii.
    436), speaking of the Johnian BLAZER, says it was always of
    the most brilliant scarlet, and thinks it not improbable
    that the fact suggested the name which subsequently became
    general.]

  1880. _Times_, June 19. Men in spotless flannel, and club BLAZERS.

  1885. _Punch_, June 27, p. 304. Harkaway turns up clad in what he
  calls a BLAZER, which makes him look like a nigger minstrel out for a
  holiday.

  1889. _Daily News_, Aug. 22, p. 6, col. 6. DRESS BY THE SEA. SIR,—In
  your article of to-day, under the above heading, you speak of “a
  striped red and black BLAZER,” “the BLAZER,” also of “the pale toned”
  ones. This is worth noting as a case of the specific becoming the
  generic. A BLAZER is the red flannel boating jacket worn by the Lady
  Margaret, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Boat Club. When I was at
  Cambridge it meant that and nothing else. It seems from your article
  that a BLAZER now means a coloured flannel jacket, whether for
  cricket, tennis, boating, or seaside wear.—Yours faithfully, WALTER
  WREN.

  1897. _Felstedian_, June, p. 99. The new football BLAZER is very
  handsome.


*Bleed*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—One who is remarkably good at
    anything.


*Bleyis-sylver* (or *Bent-sylver*), _subs._ (Royal High School,
    Edin.).—A gratuity given in olden times by pupils to
    masters. He who gave most was proclaimed “_victor_” or
    “king.” [BLEYIS is derived from _bleis_ = a torch or blaze
    (mod. Scot. _bleeze_). BLEYIS-SYLVER = silver given at
    Candlemas on the time of the bleeze. Dr. Jamieson (_Dict._)
    suggests _bent_ = Fr. _benit_, _i.e._ blessed, because money
    was given on a Saint’s day. Dr. STEVENS, the school
    historian, suggests _bent_ = coarse grass. In sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries pupils had leave to go and cut this
    coarse grass to strew on floor of school. Afterwards annual
    holidays were instituted on first Mondays of May, June, and
    July, when a money payment was made to the master to
    purchase “bent.” (_Cf._ STEVENS’ _Hist. of High School_, p.
    678.) This is more probable.]


*Block, The* (Eton).—A wooden step in the library of the Upper
    School upon which a boy set down for flogging kneels. He is
    “held down” by two junior Collegers, and the Sixth Form
    Preposter hands to the head-master the necessary birch or
    birches.


*Blockhouse*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A sick-house.


*Bloody Porch* (Harrow: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 320. Harrow fagging had no
  special reputation for cruelty; yet there are those living who can
  remember having been called out of their beds at night to have cold
  water poured down their backs—for no special reason, but as a part of
  the hardening process considered good for fags generally; or to start
  from Leith’s boarding-house in the dark, to go round the church-yard
  by the north porch—BLOODY PORCH, as it was called, from some obscure
  legend. Once a boy was sent upon this dreaded tour at night, when it
  so happened that there were a party concealed in the porch, watching
  the grave of a newly-buried relative—for these were the days of
  resurrection-men; they mistook the unfortunate fag for a
  body-snatcher, and fired at him, wounding him slightly, and
  frightening him almost to death.


*Blotch*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Blotting-paper.


*Blow*, _subs._ (old University).—A drunken frolic; a spree.
    [_Blowboll_ = a drunkard: _cf._ SKELTON (_Works_, i. 23),
    “Thou blynkerd blowboll, thou wakyst too late.”]

    _Verb_ (Winchester).—To blush. _Cf._ BLUE = to blush, as in
    quot. 1709.

  14[?]. _Torrent of Portugal_, 11. His browys began to BLOWE.

  1645. HABINGTON, _Works_. Th’enamoured spring by kissing BLOWS soft
  blushes on her cheek.

  1709. STEELE and SWIFT, _Tatler_, No. 71, p. 8. If a Virgin blushes,
  we no longer cry she BLUES.


*Blucher*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete: _ch_ hard).—A College
    præfect in half power. His jurisdiction did not extend
    beyond “Seventh Chamber passage,” though his privileges were
    the same as those of other præfects. These were eight in
    number.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 30. The
  eight senior præfects were said to have “full power,” and had some
  slight privileges not enjoyed by the remaining ten, who were generally
  called BLUCHERS.

  1864. _Blackwood_, p. 86. The remaining eight college præfects (called
  in Winchester tongue, BLUCHERS) have a more limited authority,
  confined to Chambers and the Quadrangle.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 55. The remaining eight
  college prefects (called in Winchester tongue BLUCHERS) have a more
  limited authority, confined to chambers and the quadrangle; the form
  of making these is—“_Præficio te sociis concameralibus_.” At least two
  prefects are located in each of the seven chambers—one from the first
  seven in rank, and one from the next seven. The juniors are also
  divided into ranks of seven, and out of each rank the prefects,
  according to their seniority, chose one each to fill up the numbers in
  their own chamber; so that each chamber has, to a certain extent, ties
  and associations of its own.


*Blue*, _subs._ 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—A scholar of Christ’s
    Hospital; a blue-coat boy. [Derived from the colour of the
    clothes—a blue drugget gown or body with ample skirts to it,
    a yellow vest underneath in winter time, small-clothes of
    Russia duck, worsted yellow stockings, a leathern girdle,
    and a little black worsted cap, usually carried in the hand,
    being the complete costume. This was the ordinary dress of
    children in humble life during the reigns of the Tudors.]
    _See_ Appendix.

  1834. W. TROLLOPE (_Title_), Christ’s Hospital ... with Memoirs of
  Eminent BLUES. _Ibid._ At the Spital did they first earn the title of
  BLUE by appearing in raiment of that hue. Hitherto they had worn
  russet cotton. The bands are supposed to be a relic of the ruff, as
  the girdle was of the hempen cord. The ruff was regal, or reginal, and

  picture pourtrays the dresses of the various Orders of Friars).

  1877. W. H. BLANCH, _Blue-Coat Boys_, p. 33. To some extent it holds
  also with regard to Civil Engineers, amongst whom, however, one
  well-known name is that of a BLUE.

  Present this Book is dedicated.

    2. (University).—A member of the Universities of Oxford or
    Cambridge. [The colours for inter-University sports are dark
    and light blue respectively.]

    TO GET ONE’S BLUE, _verb. phr._ (University).—To be selected
    as a competitor in inter-University sports: _cf._ “to get
    silk” (of Q.C.’s). [From the University colours.]

  1899. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Feb., p. 194. The expression “to get a BLUE”
  is a phrase which is universally recognised as applying to the
  athletics and games of the sister Universities, Oxford and Cambridge,
  and to them only. As an ardent Oxford man I do not appreciate his
  compliment; as an old Stonyhurst boy, I cannot but deplore his
  servility.


*Blue-book*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A school register (alphabetically
    arranged) comprising name, form, house, tutor, age, term of
    coming, prizes, and honours.


*Bluer*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A blue flannel coat: worn by all
    going to FOOTER (_q.v._) in winter, and cricket in summer.


*B. N. C.*, _subs._ (Oxford).—The popular abbreviation of
    Brasenose College.

  1885. _Daily News_, March 13, p. 5, col. 1. As when Corpus bumped B.
  N. C. years ago, and went head of the river, whereon a spirit of wrath
  entered into the B. N. C. men, and next night they bumped Corpus back
  again.


*Board.* TO KEEP ONE’S NAME ON THE BOARD, _verb. phr._
    (Cambridge).—To remain a member of a College.


*Boat* (The Leys).—A shallow valley, in which football is
    played.

    PROCESSION OF BOATS (Eton).—_See_ FOURTH OF JUNE.

    TO SIT A BOAT, _verb. phr._ (Eton).—_See_ quot., and FOURTH
    OF JUNE. [Long since abandoned.]

  1865. _Etoniana_, p. 170. The time-honoured custom of SITTING A BOAT
  must here claim mention. Some old Etonian, of generous and festive
  disposition (generally an old “oar”), signifies to the captain of a
  boat his intention of presenting the crew with a certain quantity of
  champagne. In return he is entitled to be rowed up to Surly in the
  boat to which he presents the wine; he occupies the coxswain’s seat,
  who kneels or stands behind him. This giver of good things is called,
  from this circumstance, a “sitter”; and the question, “Who SITS YOUR
  BOAT?” or, “Have you a sitter?” is one of some interest, which may
  often be heard addressed to a captain. The seat of honour in the
  ten-oar is usually offered to some distinguished old Etonian. Mr.
  Canning occupied it in 1824.


*Bob*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A large white beer-jug, about a
    gallon in capacity.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 85. Each
  end and præfect’s mess had their beer served up in a large white jug,
  or BOB. The vessel used for the same purpose in Commoners’ was called
  a “Joram.”

  1888. T. A. TROLLOPE, _What I Remember_. Only those “Juniors” attended
  whose office it was to bring away the portions of bread and cheese and
  BOBS of beer for consumption in the afternoon.

    _See_ DRY-BOB; WET-BOB.


*Bod*, _subs._ (Oxford).—The Bodleian Library; also Bodley.


*Bodeites* (Charterhouse).—_See_ OUT-HOUSES.


*Bodleian, The* (Oxford).—A famous library, popularly known as
    the Bodley, founded by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
    1445-80. Despoiled in 1550 and again in 1556, it was
    restored and added to in 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley. It now
    contains some 600,000 volumes, and is especially rich in
    manuscripts (some 30,000 volumes) and other literary
    treasures. James Russell Lowell, the distinguished American,
    says of this famous library: “Directly we enter, we are
    struck by the stillness and solemnity that reign around,
    helped by the dim light, the windows with painted glass, the
    ponderous shelves, the illuminated missals, the graduates or
    attendants conversing in low whispers or moving quietly
    about. For reading purposes the library is as free and as
    good as the library of the British Museum; with the
    advantages that you may be seated in front of a window
    commanding a beautiful garden prospect, that your arm-chair
    is not disturbed, that books are allowed to accumulate
    around you, and that you are not obliged to return them to
    the care of the custodian on leaving the library. The
    visitor will not fail to notice the portraits in the upper
    library, and especially to cast a grateful look at the fine
    portrait of Bodley. He will see the exercise-books used by
    Edward VI. and Elizabeth when children, and, close by, the
    autographs of distinguished visitors.”


*Boiler*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A plain coffee-pot used for
    heating water—fourpenny and sixpenny boilers, not from their
    price, but from the quantity of milk they held. το παν
    BOILERS = large tin saucepan-like vessels in which water for
    a BIDDY (_q.v._) was heated.


*Bolly*, _subs._ (Marlborough).—Pudding.


*Bom*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A servant; a waiter. [A waiter was
    once dubbed “a vile abomination”; whence the contractions
    “vile bom” and “BOM.”]


*Bond Street* (Stonyhurst).—A walk along one side of the
    playground. Once obsolete but now restored, being applied to
    another walk.


*Boner*, _subs._ (general).—A sharp blow on the spine.


*Bonner*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A bonfire.


*Bonnet.* TO HOLD THE BONNETS, _verb. phr._ (Royal High School,
    Edin.: obsolete).—To hold the bonnet or handkerchief used to
    divide High School boys when fighting.


*Bonnet-fire*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—The
    process otherwise known as “running the gauntlet.”

  1812. JAMIESON, _Dict. Scottish Language_, s.v.


*Book*, _verb_ (Westminster).—_See_ PANCAKE, and quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 172. They also claim a right
  to BOOK the performer (_i.e._ hurl a shower of books at him) if he
  fails more than once. This right was liberally exercised in 1865, when
  the wrath of the school had culminated owing to repeated failures in
  that and the previous year. The exasperated cook replied to the attack
  with his only available missile—the frying-pan—and a serious row was
  the consequence.


*Books*, _subs._ (Winchester).—1. The prizes formerly presented
    by Lord Say and Sele, now given by the governing body, to
    the “Senior” in each division at the end of “Half.” 2. The
    school is thus divided:—SIXTH BOOK—Senior and Junior
    Division; the whole of the rest of the School (but _see_
    quotations), is in FIFTH BOOK—Senior Part, Middle Part,
    Junior Part, each part being divided into so many divisions,
    Senior, Middle, and Junior, or Senior, 2nd, 3rd, and Junior,
    as the case may require. Formerly there was also “FOURTH
    BOOK,” but it ceased to exist about the middle of the
    Sixties.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 104. The
  school was divided into three classes, or BOOKS, as they were called.
  Of these, the Præfects formed one, SIXTH BOOK; FIFTH BOOK was
  subdivided into three parts, called respectively “Senior, Middle, and
  Junior part of the Fifth”; in speaking of them, the words “of the
  Fifth” were generally omitted. The rest of the boys made up “Fourth
  Book.”

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 24. The tiers of stone seats,
  which may still be noticed in the deep recesses of the windows, were
  the places in which the prefects sat when the boys were arranged in
  their respective BOOKS; the term still used at Winchester for what in
  other schools would be called “forms” or “classes.” There were then,
  as now, four BOOKS only, though the highest was and is numbered as the
  “sixth.” Then followed the fifth, fourth, and second fourth. The work
  of the sixth BOOK comprised Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, Cicero, Martial,
  and “Robinson’s Rhetoric.” _Ibid._, 36. Ninety feet long and
  thirty-six in breadth, it is sufficiently spacious to allow all the
  BOOKS to be assembled there without more confusion than is inseparable
  from the system of teaching so many distinct classes in a single
  room—an arrangement peculiar to Winchester alone amongst our large
  Public Schools.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. BOOKS. The name of the
  Classes into which the School is divided. The VI^{th}, V^{th}, and
  II^{nd} only remain. From _Liber_ in the sense of _Roll_ probably.

    UP TO BOOKS.—In class; repeating lessons; formerly UP AT
    BOOKS.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 101. At
  each end of school are three tiers of benches rising gradually one
  above the other,—that on the ground being called “Senior Row,” and the
  others “Middle” and “Junior Row” respectively. On these the Classes
  sit when UP AT BOOKS, _i.e._ when repeating lessons.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. BOOK. This word was formerly
  used for any composition, from a volume to a single sheet,
  particularly where a list is spoken of. See the _State Papers_, i.
  402.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 37. Three tiers of fixed seats
  rise against the wainscotted walls on the east and west, where the
  boys are arranged when UP TO BOOKS, the chairs of the different
  masters being in front of each.

  1872. WALCOTT, _Traditions and Customs of Cathedrals_, “Statutes of
  Chichester Cathedral.” Four wax candles are always distributed at the
  end of Lauds, at the four uppermost BOOKS, to the Senior set of the
  BOOKS, to find the lights to the same BOOKS for that time. [Note to
  foregoing:—At Winchester College the Forms are still called BOOKS.]

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, 417, _s.v._

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. BOOKS. It has been
  suggested that this phrase arose from the school having originally to
  go up to the Donatus—the one book which College boasted; and an entry
  is extant of a three days’ remedy being entailed by the book going to
  be bound. The pluralization would be no more than an ordinary
  Wykehamical inflection.... The following mysterious use of _Libri_,
  however, suggests a much more probable origin. CHRIS. JOHNSON says:
  “_Seu Chandlerus erat, seu Custos ordine primus, Durus ab inductis
  dicitur esse LIBRIS!_” To which a contemporaneous note is appended:
  “_Lectionum a cæna repetitiones instituisse creditur, quas Wiccamici
  materna lingua Libros dicunt._” What these “repetitiones” were is not
  clear; but they were some form of lesson which præ-Elizabethan
  Wykehamists had christened BOOKS in their _materna lingua_, and
  Johnson’s annotator thought the word strange enough to deserve a note.
  We may, therefore, very possibly be only perpetuating this word in our
  use of UP TO BOOKS.

    BOOKS CHAMBERS.—Explained by quotations.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 103. On
  Remedies (a kind of whole holiday) we also went into school in the
  morning and afternoon for an hour or two without masters; this was
  called BOOKS CHAMBERS; and on Sundays, from four till a quarter to
  five.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. BOOKS-CHAMBERS. Hours of
  preparation in College: in the evening called Toy-time.

    TO GET (or MAKE) BOOKS.—To get the first place, or to make
    the highest score at anything. _Cf._ BOOKS, sense 1.


*Bookwork*, _subs._ (University).—Mathematics that can be
    learned _verbatim_ from books—anything not a problem.


*Boots-and-Leathers*, _intj._ (Winchester).—_See_ PEAL.


*Bostruchyzer*, _subs._ (Oxford: obsolete).—A small comb for
    curling the whiskers.—HOTTEN.


*Botany-bay*, _subs._ (University).—(1) Worcester College,
    Oxford; and (2) part of Trinity College, Dublin. [On account
    of their remote situations.]

  1841. LEVER, _Charles O’Malley_, xx. note. BOTANY BAY was the slang
  name given by college men to a new square rather remotely situated
  from the remainder of the college [_i.e._ Trinity, Dublin].

  1853. Rev. E. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Adventures of Verdant
  Green_, i. p. 63. BOTANY-BAY, a name given to Worcester College, from
  its being the most distant college.

  1886. GRAVES, _Way about Oxfordshire_, 19. At the end is Worcester
  College (1714), from its remote position dubbed ... BOTANY-BAY, but
  called by those who wish to speak endearingly of it “Wuggins.”

  1900. _Athenæum_, 17th Feb., 208. BOTANY-BAY is often found as
  strangely misapplied as the “Paradise” of so many rows. For instance,
  the “Quad” of Trinity College, Dublin, which has been so called for
  generations, can hardly have ever been remarkable for its flora. The
  probable explanation is that its buildings were old and uncomfortable,
  and it was the favourite abode of the youngest and noisiest members of
  the University.


*Botolph’s*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A “Run” to St. Botolph’s
    Church.


*Bottle*, _verb_ (Durham: obsolete).—To make hot: _e.g._ I got
    regularly BOTTLED in that room; specifically, “to roast” a
    boy before a fire. _See_ Appendix.


*Bottled.* TO BE BOTTLED, _verb. phr._ (Sherborne).—To be turned
    in work.


*Bottom-side*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A wing: at football. The lower
    wing (if one be lower than the other); as a rule the one
    farthest from the hill.


*Boule*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A general confab or
    conversation. _See_ PRIVEE.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 82. There was a BOULE (βουλή) once in the
  Sixth Form of 1872 as to what a monitor should do if he were thus
  insulted [by a visit of a master to Banco].


*Bounce.* FIRST BOUNCE, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A goal (which is
    never allowed) taken by a “drop-kick” at football.

    SECOND BOUNCE, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A kind of
    HANDBALL (_q.v._) once very popular.

  1887. _Stonyhurst Mag._, July, p. 18, “Stonyhurst in the Fifties.”
  SECOND BOUNCE, a variety of handball played with small balls most
  artistically made of strips of indiarubber, and covered with the best
  kid-leather. These balls had to be taken to pieces and remade after
  every match, and they had to be quite freshly made when used. Their
  seams required to be frequently rubbed over with wax, some of which
  was always smeared on the handball wall for the purpose. For a game of
  SECOND BOUNCE a whole side of one of the big handballs was required,
  and it was played by eight players, four a side. The “over-all” of
  ordinary handball was the “over line,” and the bulk of the players
  stood out yards beyond it. He whose “hand” it was bounced the ball,
  and with a long strong swing of his arm hit it up against the wall,
  whence with a sharp smack it rebounded high in the air and far out
  into the ground. As it descended one of the opposite party stopped it
  with his hand and let it BOUNCE twice on the ground, the FIRST BOUNCE
  being, as a rule, too high to let him strike it, and then with a
  similar swing hit it up again. The rules, except as to permitting the
  ball to be taken up at the SECOND BOUNCE, were similar to those of
  handball. Balls perished quickly in such a game, nearly a dozen being
  required for one. SECOND BOUNCE used chiefly to be played on Sunday
  afternoon, after Vespers, and almost all not engaged in the game would
  range themselves on the flanks to watch.


*Bounder*, _subs._ (University).—A dog-cart.


*Bounds*, _subs._ (general).—The limit or the boundaries beyond
    which it is not permissible to go.

    ON BOUNDS (Stonyhurst).—A punishment to which a boy who has
    been flagrantly “out of bounds” (the term as in other Public
    Schools) is subjected. He is confined during ordinary
    recreations to a very limited portion of the playground.
    Such a boy is said to be “put ON BOUNDS.”


*Bowing-round Sunday*, _subs. phr._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_
    PUBLIC-SUPPING.

  1854. “Our Rebellion” [_The Blue_ (1871) July]. Next day was
  BOWING-ROUND SUNDAY. “Hand down, don’t bow,” was the signal that
  passed down our ranks as we stood in the Hall Cloisters, and many were
  the black looks, but few the nods of reverence, our Treasurer and his
  two attendant governors got that morning.


*Bowl*, _verb._ 1. (general).—To master; to succeed: as in a
    paper, a lesson, an examination, &c.; to overcome: as a
    difficulty, an examiner, &c. _See_ FLOOR and THROW.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 55. My Coach says he thinks I
  shall BOWL over the Examiners next term in the General.

    2. (Winchester).—To “pluck” or “plough” up to books; TO
    CROPPLE (_q.v._).


*Box*, _verb._ 1. (Westminster).—To take possession of; “to
    bag.”

    2. (Stonyhurst).—To strike a ball with the closed hand when
    in the air. _See_ STONYHURST-FOOTBALL.

    3. (Charterhouse).—Of books: if a member of a House Library
    Committee finds a library book lying about, he calls out the
    name of the book three times at the top of his voice, and
    adds, “BOXED!” The boy who has taken out the book thus BOXED
    is fined sixpence, saving the fine if he shouts “Mine!”
    before the word of confiscation is uttered.


*Box-buildings*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete).—The Sanatorium:
    in the seventeenth century called SICK-HOUSE (_q.v._), and
    subsequently BOX-BUILDINGS. These buildings were pulled down
    in 1850 and the name disappeared.


*Boy*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A grade of fag. The Lower School are
    put ON BOY, in turns, to go messages, &c., for the Sixth
    Form. _See_ Appendix.


*Brasenose* (or *B. N. C.*), _subs._ (Oxford).—Brasenose
    College. [Founded in 1509 on the site of four ancient
    Halls—Little University Hall was one, another being
    Brasenose Hall (thirteenth century). Authorities differ as
    to the origin of the curious name. _See_ quots.]

  1512. _Charter of Henry VIII._ The King’s Hall and College of
  BRASENOSE.

  1800. CHURTON, _Life of Bishop Smith_, 227. Brazen Nose Hall, as the
  Oxford antiquary has shown, may be traced as far back as the time of
  Henry III., about the middle of the thirteenth century; and early in
  the succeeding reign, 6 Edward I., 1278, it was known by the name of
  Brasen Nose Hall, which peculiar name was undoubtedly owing, as the
  same author observes, to the circumstance of a nose of brass affixed
  to the gate. It is presumed, however, that this conspicuous appendage
  of the portal was not formed of the mixed metal which the word now
  denotes, but the genuine produce of the mine; as is the nose, or
  rather face, of a lion or leopard still remaining at Stamford, which
  also gave name to the edifice it adorned. And hence, when Henry VIII.
  debased the coin by an alloy of _copper_, it was a common remark or
  proverb, that “Testons were gone to Oxford, to study in _Brasen_
  Nose.”

  1837. INGRAM, _Memorials of Oxford_. BRASENOSE.... This curious
  appellation, which, whatever was the origin of it, has been
  perpetuated by the symbol of a brazen nose here and at Stamford,
  occurs with the modern orthography, but in one undivided word, so
  early as 1278, in an inquisition now printed in _The Hundred Rolls_,
  though quoted by Wood from the manuscript record.

  1837. _British Critic_, xxiv. 139. There is a spot in the centre of
  the city where Alfred is said to have lived. BRASENOSE claims his
  palace, Oriel his church, and University his school or academy. Of
  these BRASENOSE is still called “the King’s Hall,” which is the name
  by which Alfred himself, in his laws, calls his palace; and it has its
  present singular name from a corruption of _brasinium_, or
  _brasin-huse_, as having been originally located in that part of the
  royal mansion which was devoted to the then important accommodation of
  a brew-house.

  1898. ALDEN, _Oxford Guide_, 52. Brasenose Hall (thirteenth century)
  is said to have derived the name from its occupying the site of a
  _brasen-hus_ or brewhouse. Over the old entrance-gate is the
  representation of a _brazen nose_, probably added at a much later
  date, when punning rebuses of this kind were in fashion.


*Brasser*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—A bully.


*Bread-and-beer*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—The name given to
    the snack which boys may take at five o’clock.


*Bread-boy*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  1798. Narrative “Christ’s Hospital, Three quarters of a Century ago”
  [_Chelmsford Chronicle_ (1875), Ap. 16]. The breakfast-bell rang about
  seven, when we all went into the hall, the nurses following, with boys
  from each ward (called BREAD-BOYS) carrying large baskets on their
  shoulders containing bread, which were taken to the head of each
  table, where stood the nurse, who, after “grace,” went down the table,
  serving out to each boy half of a twopenny loaf of bread. “Well,”
  you’ll say, “but where’s the butter?” None was allowed—nothing but
  bare bread. Those who had been sparing over night to save a portion of
  the small piece of cheese they had for their supper, pulled it out of
  their pockets. Sometimes a great fellow would make a little boy always
  supply him with cheese of mornings, out of the piece the poor fellow
  had had for his supper the night previous. Beer we had certainly,
  served out in wooden vessels of an extraordinary shape, called
  “piggins”; about six of them for four boys to drink out of, but such
  beer! The piggins were seldom replenished, for we could not drink it.
  We used to call it “the washings of the brewers’ aprons.”

  1900. _Pall Mall Gazette_, 20th March, 3. 2. “A Lenten Supper.” Last
  of all the BREAD-BOY hoists the tall bread-basket shoulder high and
  bows round with it, never failing to raise a laugh as well as a
  basket.


*Bread-picker*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A Junior
    appointed by the four senior Præfects in Commoners: at one
    time to put candles in outhouses; but formerly the word is
    supposed to relate to the duty of securing bread when served
    out. The office exempted from fagging at meal times.


*Brekker*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Breakfast.

  1898. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” Each
  undergraduate has two rooms, a bedroom and a sitting-room. In these he
  lives, studies, and, with the exception of evening dinner in the Hall,
  has his meals. He is thus able to entertain. The fashionable meal to
  which to invite a friend is breakfast, or vernacularly BREKKER.


*Brew*, _verb._ 1. (Marlborough).—To make afternoon tea.

    2. (Harrow).—To knock about; to damage.

    3. (Harrow).—To cook. Hence, as _subs._ = a mess, or
    self-cooked meal.


*Brick*, _verb_ (Charterhouse).—To hustle; TO MOB UP (_q.v._);
    TO BARGE (_q.v._).


*Bricks*, _subs._ (Wellington).—A kind of pudding. [Also (var.
    dial.) = a kind of loaf.]


*Bridge of Grunts* (Cambridge).—_See_ ISTHMUS OF SUEZ.


*Bring-on*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A SIZING (_q.v._), or extra in
    the way of food (as jam, tinned meat, &c.). [That is, what a
    boy “BRINGS ON” to his table, chiefly at tea.]


*Broad* (The), _subs._ (Oxford).—Broad Street.


*Broad-sheet*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The printed school list: issued
    after the TRIALS (_q.v._).


*Brock*, _subs._ (Winchester).—To bully; to tease; to badger.
    [BROCK, provincial in North and Hants = a badger, and
    baiting these animals was a school sport till 1870.] Hence
    BROCKSTER = a bully.


*Brogues*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Breeches. [An old
    English survival: still dial. in Suffolk.]


*Broker*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A member of Pembroke College.


*Brooke Hall* (Charterhouse).—At Old Charterhouse the officers’
    common room; at New Charterhouse the masters’ common room:
    it is the place to which impositions must be taken.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, p. 94. In the seventeenth century
  schoolmasters had to be careful of their politics. Thus Master Robert
  Brooke, the fourth of the “schoolmasters,” is said to have refused to
  sign the Solemn League and Covenant, and to have flogged some of his
  boys for Parliamentary proclivities. He was ejected from his office in
  1643. At the Restoration, though not fully restored, he was given “two
  chambers in cloisters and a pension of £30 a year.” After his death
  these two chambers were knocked into one and it became BROOKE HALL.

*Brosier* (or *Brozier*). TO BROZIER MY DAME, _verb. phr._
    (Eton).—To “eat out of house and home.” When a DAME (_q.v._)
    keeps an unusually bad table, the boys agree on a certain
    day to eat him literally “out of house and home.” Hence
    BROZIERED = cleaned out. [_Brozier_ (Cheshire) = bankrupt.]

  1796. MERTON, _Way to get Married_ (INCHBALD, _British Theatre_, vol.
  xxvi.). [The term is so used here.]


*Browse*, _subs._ (Marlborough).—A pleasant or easy time; a
    treat; anything enjoyable: _e.g._ MORNING BROWSE = leave off
    early school; French is a BROWSE. Hence, CAPTAIN’S BROWSE =
    an expedition to which a master takes his House Captains.
    [From _browse_ = to eat lazily.]

    _Adj._ Pleasant; enjoyable. Also (more frequently) BROWSY:
    _e.g._ a BROWSY morning = a morning in which little work is
    done; an awfully BROWSY day, or time = an enjoyable time.

    _Verb._ To enjoy; to like: generally with _on_: _e.g._ “I
    BROWSE ON old Smith,” or, “ON Science hour.”

*Brute*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—_See_ quot. Also BEAST.

  1868. BREWER, _Phrase and Fable_, s.v. BRUTE, in Cambridge University
  slang, is a man who has not yet matriculated. The play is evident. A
  “man” in college phrase is a collegian; and as matriculation is the
  sign and seal of acceptance, a scholar before that ceremony is not a
  “man,” and therefore only a “BIPED BRUTE.”


*Buck*, _adj._ 1. (Winchester: obsolete).—Handsome.

    2. (Felsted).—Fine; jolly.

  1897. _Felstedian_, July, p. 129. What’s the good of a Præfect? he

  night was dark, and they reached the College in safety.

  1847. TENNYSON, _Princess_, Prologue. We unworthier told Of college;
  he had climb’d across the spikes, And he had squeezed himself betwixt
  the bars, And he had breath’d the Proctor’s DOGS.

  1880. BREWER, _Reader’s Handbook_. BULL-DOGS, the two servants of a

    the Rugby SCRUMMAGE (_q.v._), and the Winchester HOT
    (_q.v._).


*Bunker’s Hill* (Stonyhurst).—A row of cottages outside Hodder
    grounds. Originally called Bankhurst, but after a battle
    here between the inhabitants and the new-comers a century
    ago, its present name was given to it. (See _Stonyhurst
    Mag._, ii. 92.)


*Bum-brusher*, _subs._ (general).—A schoolmaster; also an usher.

    1835 by members of Caius College.

  1835. (Quoted in WHIBLEY’S _Three Centuries of Cambridge Wit_ [1889].)
  ’Tis the College of Caius—’tis the land where the “BUM-CURTAIN” lately
  was sported by each jolly chum, But now black and blue are the gowns
  that they wear Like the eye of a drunkard returned from a fair.


*Bumf*, _subs._ (general).—Paper. _See_ Appendix.

*Bumping-race*, _subs._ (University).—Eight-oared
    inter-Collegiate races, rowed in two divisions of fifteen
    and sixteen boats respectively, including a SANDWICH BOAT
    (_q.v._), _i.e._ the top boat of the second division, which
    rows bottom of the first. The boats in each division start
    at a distance apart of 175 feet from stern to stern in the
    order at which they left off at the last preceding race, and
    any boat which overtakes and BUMPS another (_i.e._ touches
    it in any part) before the winning post is reached, changes
    places with it for the next race. Hence BUMP-SUPPER = a
    supper to commemorate the event.

  1849. THACKERAY, _Pendennis_, iii. He listened, and with respect too,
  to Mr. Foker’s accounts of what the men did at the University of which
  Mr. F. was an ornament, and encountered a long series of stories about
  boat-racing, BUMPING, College grass-plats, and milk-punch.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, x. A BUMP-SUPPER—that is, O ye
  uninitiated! a supper to commemorate the fact of the boat of one
  College having, in the annual races, BUMPED, or touched the boat of
  another College immediately in its front, thereby gaining a place
  towards the head of the river,—a BUMP-SUPPER was a famous opportunity
  for discovering both the rowing and paying capabilities of Freshmen,
  who, in the enthusiasm of the moment, would put down their two or
  three guineas, and at once propose their names to be enrolled as
  members at the next meeting of the club.

  1860. _Macmillan’s Magazine_, March, p. 331. The chances of St.
  Ambrose’s making a BUMP the first night were weighed.

  1865. _Sketches from Cambridge_, p. 7. I can still condescend to give
  our boat a stout when it makes a BUMP.

  who can’t afford a coach get a CAB, _alias_ a crib, _alias_ a
  translation.

  1876. _Academy_, 4th Nov., p. 448, col. 2. The use of translations,
  “cribs,” or CABS as boys call them, must at some time or other engage
  the serious attention of schoolmasters.


*Cabbage*, _subs._ (general).—A translation; a CAB (_q.v._).
    Also as _verb_ = to use a translation or other adventitious

  is destined to give place to the (comparatively) gilded splendour of a
  Philosopher’s room. Two new windows are being opened in the wall of
  the Elizabethan front over the old Bailey window.... Hitherto CACUS
  has been shrouded in utter darkness, ... a receptacle for ... all the
  literature, which ... had not been assigned a place in the Library.


*Cad*, _subs._ (general).—A non-school or non-University man: in
    contempt. At Cambridge SNOB, the word Thackeray used, has
    long been a common term for a townsman; now the undergrad.
    says TOWNEE or TOWNER (_q.v._). The German analogue is
    PHILISTER.

  1831. HONE, _Year-Book_, 670. Preceded by one or two bands of music in
  two boats, rowed by CADS.

  1856. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Adventures of Verdant Green_, i. p.
  117. And I can chaff a CAD.

  1860. _Macmillan’s Mag._, March, p. 327. You don’t think a gentleman
  can lick a CAD, unless he is the biggest and strongest of the two.

  1873. _Saturday Review_, September, p. 305. At Oxford the population
  of the University and city is divided into “Dons, men, and CADS.”

  came down in cap and gown to CALLING-OVER, and the whole school of
  three hundred boys swept into the big school to answer to their names.


*Calton.* SEE YOU ON THE CALTON, _phr._ (Royal High School,
    Edin.).—A challenge to fight. [The Calton Hill lies at the
    back of the school; it and THE DUNGEONS (_q.v._) are the two
    fighting grounds.]


*Calves*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Pronounced _Caves_. _See_
    HALVES.


*Calx*, _subs._ (Eton).—The goal line at football. [From a Latin
    sense of CALX = a goal, anciently marked with lime or
    chalk.] At Eton CALX is a space so marked off at each end of
    WALL; GOOD CALX is the end at which there is a door for a
    goal; BAD CALX the end where part of an elm-tree serves the
    purpose.

  1864. _Daily Telegraph_, Dec. 1. The Collegers were over-weighted ...
  and the Oppidans managed to get the ball down into their CALX several
  times.


*Campus Martius*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—Until
    recently the name by which the battle-ground in THE DUNGEONS

    encounters between different classes.


*Canals, The* (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The two ponds in front of
    the College.


*Candle-keepers*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The seven seniors in

    the privileges of Præfects without their powers.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 30. The
  Seven CANDLE-KEEPERS (why so called I have no idea, nor have I ever
  heard any interpretation of the appellation). These were the seven
  inferiors who had been longest in the school, quite independently of
  their position in it; they were generally old and tough. Of these, the
  senior had almost as much power as a Præfect; he had a “valet” in
  chambers, one or two “breakfast fags,” and the power of fagging the
  twenty juniors when in school or in meads. The junior CANDLE-KEEPER
  was called the “Deputy,” and had also some slight privileges besides
  that of having a valet and breakfast fag, which was common to all of
  them.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, p. 418. _See_ Appendix.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” The
  CANDLE-KEEPERS are the next in chambers to the præfects; generally
  fellows who have not much brains, but from having been a long time in
  the school, having a certain number of “juniors,” and are excused
  fagging and have certain minor privileges approaching those of a
  præfect.


*Candlestick*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A humorous corruption of
    the word “candidate.”

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 175.
  Each of these [the Electors] had in turn the privilege of nominating a
  boy for admission into Winchester till all vacancies were filled, of
  which there were generally about twelve, but always many more
  “Candidates” (or CANDLESTICKS, as they were often called).

  1878. H. C. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, p. 418. CANDLESTICK, merely a
  facetious version of “candidate.”


*Cannager-canoodle*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A Canadian canoe.

  1893. _Felstedian_, June, p. 718, “Oxford Correspondence.” The Char
  has been daily gay with bright yellow “CANAGGER-CANOODLES,” and
  pink-and-green Japanese parasols and wobbling punts with their
  sleeping occupants.


*Cannibal*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—In a BUMPING-RACE (_q.v._) a
    College may be represented by more than one boat. The best
    talent is put into the first, but it has sometimes happened
    that the crew of the second have got so well together that
    it has disappointed the prophets and bumped the first of its
    own College. In this case it is termed A CANNIBAL, it having
    eaten up its own kind, and a fine is exacted from it by the
    University Boat Club.


*Canoodle*, _verb_ (Oxford).—To paddle or propel a canoe.

  1879. E. H. MARSHALL, in _Notes and Queries_, 5 S., xi. 375. When I
  was an undergraduate at Oxford, to CANOODLE was the slang expression
  for paddling one’s own canoe on the bosom of the Cherwell or the Isis.


*Cantab*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A student at Cambridge
    University. [An abbreviation of “CANTABRIGIAN.”]

  1750. COVENTRY, _Pompey Litt._, II. x. (1785), p. 18, col. 1. The
  young CANTAB ... had come up to London.

  1803. _Gradus ad_ CANTAB. (Title.)

  1821. BYRON, _Don Juan_, c. iii., st. 126. And I grown out of many
  “wooden spoons” Of verse (the name with which we CANTABS please To dub
  the last of honours in degrees).


*Canvas*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 66. The Winchester football
  game is peculiar. It is played in CANVAS, as it is called. A portion
  of Meads, some 80 feet by 25, is marked off by screens of canvas on
  each side, within which the game is played, the two open ends forming
  the lines of goal, across which the ball is to be kicked. It is placed
  in the middle of the ground to begin with, and a “hot” formed round it
  by the players stooping down all close together, with their heads
  down, and at a given signal trying to force the ball or each other
  away. The canvas screens answer to the Rugby “line of touch”; when the
  ball escapes over these it is returned into play by juniors stationed
  for the purpose, and a hot is formed afresh.

    TO GO ON THE CANVAS, _verb. phr._ (Manchester Grammar).—To
    finish drill (dumb-bells, clubs, &c.), and do gymnastic
    exercises on the ladder, bars, rings, and ropes. [The floor
    beneath the latter was once covered with stuffed canvas; the
    phrase is retained, though the canvas has given way to
    mats.]


*Cap*, _subs._ 1. (Westminster).—The collection at Play and
    Election dinners. [The College cap was passed round on the
    last night of Play for contributions. _Cf._ “to send round
    the cap.”]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 157. Queen Elizabeth seems to
  have been present on at least one occasion, and to have contributed
  liberally to the CAP, for she is recorded to have paid, in January
  1564, the sum of £8, 6s. 8d. for certain plays by the grammar school
  at Westminster and the children at Powle’s. A shout of “CAP, CAP!”
  arises, and all available trenchers having been pressed into the
  service, the captain distributes them amongst the Old Westminster
  portion of the audience, who present substantial proofs of their
  satisfaction. The sum collected in the CAP has frequently amounted to
  above £200. After discharging all expenses of the play the surplus is
  divided among the performers. But as these expenses have a natural
  tendency to increase rather than diminish, while the number of old
  Westminsters present is necessarily fewer than in the more prosperous
  days of the school, the balance has of late been now and then on the
  wrong side.

    2. (Harrow).—A cap of House Colours, given by Captains of
    House Cricket elevens to the House eleven, or to some of
    them. The gift confers permanent membership. Hence, the
    recipient of such a distinction. _See_ FEZ.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 94. Second Eleven matches are played
  between the various Houses, and a challenge cup is presented at the
  end of the term to the best house. No CAP may play in these matches.

    3. (Rugby).—Each House had [1871] two CAPS, one the football
    cap and the other the house-cap. The former was a sign of
    distinction, and worn only by the few boys in the school to
    whom it had been given.... If a boy distinguished himself in
    cricket, he was allowed to wear a red band; or, as a higher
    distinction, a blue band.... Distinctions might be varied in
    all manner of ways according as a boy had won his red or his
    blue band, his flannels, or his cap.... CAPS are now (1890)
    given by the head of the School Fifteen. After the CAPS come
    the FLANNELS (_q.v._), and then come the players without
    distinction. The CAPS and FLANNELS in each House go to make
    up the House Fifteen; the FLANNELS, without the CAPS, go to
    make up the second fifteen in each House, which is called
    BELOW CAPS, or for brevity, BELOW. The next fifteen in each
    House are called TWO BELOWS, and so on, though it rarely
    happens that a House has more BELOWS than two.—LEES KNOWLES.

    _Verb_ (general).—To take off or touch one’s hat in
    salutation: also TO CAP TO and TO CAP IT.

  1593. H. SMITH, _Scrm._ (1871), i. 203. How would they CAP me were I
  in velvets.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_, p. 23, _s.v._ BORE. Other bores are to
  attend a sermon at St. Mary’s on Sunday ... TO CAP a fellow.


*Captain of Election*, _subs._ (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 183. The CAPTAIN OF
  ELECTION—the boy who gains first place—has the privilege of being
  almost entirely exempted from the fagging incidental to his junior
  year, and has his name painted on the election board in gold letters.
  These tablets, fixed up in the dormitory, go back as far as 1629; and
  among the names of the CAPTAINS, besides Lord Mansfield, as already
  mentioned, may be read those of Markman, Warren Hastings, Cyril
  Jackson and his brother the bishop, Randolph (Bishop), Abbot
  (Speaker), Longley, &c.


*Captain of the Boats*, _subs. phr._ (Eton).—_See_ quot.

  1865. _Etoniana_, p. 164. The CAPTAIN OF THE BOATS is perhaps the
  greatest person in the school next to the head-master—if, indeed, he
  does not rival that great authority in the estimation of the boys. The
  whole regulation of the boats, both as to the selection of the crew of
  the racing “eight,” and of the CAPTAINS of the several boats which
  form the Fourth of June procession, rests entirely with him; and as he
  has a great deal of this kind of patronage at his disposal, his
  influence is very considerable. The boat crews are in some sort looked
  upon as the aristocracy of the school, and for this reason the
  position is an object of social ambition amongst the boys.


*Cargo*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A hamper from home. The word is
    still in use.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 77. The
  boys, eager for breakfast, tumultuously rushed out from school-court
  ... to see if Poole, the porter, had letters, or, what was even more
  delightful, a CARGO (a hamper of game or eatables from home).

  1881. PASCOE, _Every-day Life in our Public Schools_. Scholars may
  supplement their fare with jam, potted meats, ... or, better still,
  from the contents of CARGOES, _i.e._ hampers from home.


*Cart*, _verb_ (University).—To defeat: in a match, a fight, an
    examination, a race, &c. “We CARTED them home” = we gave
    them an awful licking.


*Case*, _subs._ (Westminster).—The discussion by Seniors and
    Upper Election preceding a TANNING (_q.v._), and the tanning
    itself.


*Cathedral*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A silk hat. [Because worn
    when going to Cathedral.]


*Cat-and-cartridge*, _subs._ (The Leys).—Rabbit (or chicken)
    with sausage.


*Cat’s*, _subs._ (University).—St. Catharine’s Hall. Hence
    CAT’S-MEN = members of St. Catharine’s Hall.

    _Intj._ (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—The II^{nd}
    Class. [Formerly it used to be a custom for the II^{nd}
    class to pursue the I^{st} shouting “Gaits! Gaits!
    Gai-ai-aits,” to which they replied, “CATS! CATS! Caa-ats!”]
    _See_ DOGS.


*Cat’s Head*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—The end of a
    shoulder of mutton.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 84. His
  meal [dinner] took place at six o’clock P.M. in College (in Commoners’
  it was at _one_); it was ample in quantity, and excellent in quality.
  That of the Præfects was nicely served in joints, that of the
  Inferiors was divided into portions (Dispars); there were, if I
  remember rightly, six of these to a shoulder, and eight to a leg of
  mutton, the other joints being divided in like proportion. All these
  “Dispars” had different names; the thick slice out of the centre was
  called “a Middle Cut,” that out of the shoulder a “Fleshy,” the ribs
  “Racks,” the loin “Long Dispars”; these were the best, the more
  indifferent were the end of the shoulder, or CAT’S HEAD, the breast,
  or “Fat Flab,” &c. &c.


*Cat’s-skin*, _subs._ (Rugby).—1. _See_ quot.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, v. His go-to-meeting roof, as
  his new friend called it. But this didn’t quite suit his fastidious
  taste in another minute, being too shiny; so, as they walk up the
  town, they dive into Nixon’s the hatter’s, and Tom is arrayed, to his
  utter astonishment, and without paying for it, in a regulation
  CAT-SKIN at seven-and-sixpence.

    2. _See_ RABBIT-SKIN.


*Cause-money*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—Up-keep money for
    the path leading to HILLS (_q.v._).

  1891. WRENCH, _Word-Book_, s.v. CAUSE-MONEY. Money paid for the
  maintenance of the path leading from College towards Hills.


*Causey, The* (Stonyhurst).—The avenue between the two ponds in
    front of the College.


*Cave*, _intj._ (Eton).—“Beware!” A byword among boys out of
    bounds when a master is in sight. [From the Latin.]


*Cedar*, _subs._ (Eton).—A pair-oared boat inrigged, without
    canvas, and very “crank.” [No longer in use.]


*Certificate Good-day*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—_See_
    GOOD-DAY.


*Chaff*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—A small article or
    plaything. Also as _verb_ = to exchange; to barter. [A.S.
    _chaffere_ = to deal, exchange, or barter: as _sub._ =
    merchandise. Also (North) _chaffle_ = to haggle.]

  1388. WIMBELTON, _Sermon_ [MS. Hatton, 57, p. 4]. If thou art a
  margchaunt, disceyve not thi brother in CHAFFARYNG.

  1440. _Promptorium Parvulorum_ [MS. Harl. 221, ff. 206]. Rooryne or
  chaungyne on CHAFFARE for another.

  1450. _MS._ Bibl. Reg. 12 B. i. f. 19. _Emere vel vendere_, Anglice to
  CHAFFARYN.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874].
  Pocket-knives, combs, “precious” marbles, tops, and all the other
  numerous nondescript articles which go to make up the CHAFFS of a
  Blue.

  1877. BLANCH, _Blue-Coat Boys_, 96. CHAFF me your knife.

    _Adj._ Pleasant; glad. Also CHAFFY. [Possibly, in this
    sense, a memory of chaff = banter.] Whence, CHAFF FOR YOU =
    “So much the better for you.” _Cf._ VEX.

    _Intj._ An exclamation of joy or pleasure.


*Challenge*, _subs._ (Westminster).—The entrance examination for
    Queen’s Scholarship. _See_ quot. [In ancient times (_vide_
    STOW) St. Peter’s was one of the three great schools whose
    scholars were accustomed on the days of their patron Saints
    to challenge each other to a contest of grammar and
    versification, which was apparently the earliest form of
    what was afterwards developed not only into the Westminster
    CHALLENGE, but into the Eton MONTEM (_q.v._).]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 182. He undergoes a very
  severe examination, called the CHALLENGE, the form of which must have
  been preserved from Queen Elizabeth’s days, and is the last surviving
  relic of the old scholastic disputations.


*Chamber-day*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A day on which access
    was allowed to CHAMBERS (_q.v._) during the whole
    day.—MANSFIELD.


*Chambers*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The College bedrooms: in
    Commoners called GALLERIES (_q.v._). [CHAMBER is commonly
    dialectical for bedroom.] _See_ ELECTION CHAMBER.


*Charity-remove*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A “remove” assigned to boys
    who have remained in the Form below for several successive
    school quarters.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 297. The intention of these
  CHARITY-REMOVES (as they are called) is to prevent boys of dull
  abilities being continually outstripped in the race of promotion by
  boys younger than themselves; but practically the cases are very few
  of boys who would be left in the same Form for above three quarters;
  and even then the promotion is removed if the boy has been
  “notoriously and ostentatiously” idle.


*Charity-tails*, _subs._ (Harrow).—_See_ TAILS.


*Charlies*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—Thick gloves made of
    twine. [Introduced by a Mr. Charles Griffith: hence the
    name.]


*Chase*, _verb_ (Christ’s Hospital).—To abscond; to run away; as
    from school.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874]. At
  length, to the consternation and perplexity of the authorities, and
  the delight, admiration, and envy of the fellows, this incorrigible
  character capped all his former misdeeds by an act of pluck and daring
  which gained for himself, from that time forth, all the honours of a
  hero—he CHASED.


*Chaw*, _subs._ 1. (University).—A trick; a device; a sell.

    2. (Harrow).—A CAD (_q.v._); any non-member of the school.
    Whence WORKER-CHAW = the boy who runs messages, &c., for the
    work-shop. Also as _verb_ (football), to play roughly. TO BE
    CHAWED = to be injured.


*Check-nights*, _subs._ (Eton).—Rehearsals of the FOURTH OF JUNE
    (_q.v._) performance. Held every alternate Saturday in the
    boating season, when the crews rowed up to Surly in their
    uniform and there regaled themselves—the staple luxury being
    ducks and green pease. These suppers were open to much
    objection, and the custom has lately been done away
    with.—_Etoniana_ (1865).


*Cheese*, _subs._ (Schools and University).—An adept; one
    who “takes the shine out of another”; at Cambridge an
    overdressed dandy = a HOWLING CHEESE.

  1864. HEMYNG, _Eton School-days_. “Do you know Homer, Purefoy?” asked
  Chudleigh. “No, I have not looked at the lesson yet.” “I am sure I
  don’t know why you ever do; you are such a CHEESE. I want you to give
  me a construe.”


*Chemmy*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar).—Chemistry.


*Chief*, _subs._ (Sherborne).—The Head-master.


*Child*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—1. A scholar on the
    foundation.

  1547. Inj. Ed. VI. Commiss. [_William of Wykeham_, 152]. Item: that
  all graces to be said or sung at meals within the said College, and
  other prayers which the said scholars or CHILDREN are bound to use
  shall be henceforth sung or said evermore in English.

  _d._ 1711. KEN, _Manual ... for the use of ... Winchester College_. If
  you are a Commoner, you may say your prayers in your own Chamber; but
  if you are a CHILD or a Chorister, then to avoid the interruptions of
  the Common Chambers, go into the Chappel, between first and second
  Peal in the morning, to say your Morning Prayers, and say your Evening
  Prayers when you go _Circum_.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. CHILD. The word “Scholar,”
  as used by Ken, included the three classes—“Children,” Commoners, and
  Choristers; and it is observable that, though it has been adopted of
  late officially to designate the “Children” exclusively, this usage
  has not extended to the school. “CHILD” has fallen into desuetude, but
  its place has not been supplied by any other term.

    2. _See_ quot. 1891.

  1822. NARES, _Glossary_, s.v. CHILD ... The “CHILDREN of the Chapel”
  signifies the boys of the Chapel.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 64. One table, by a curious
  traditionary custom, is called the CHILDREN’S table—the electors
  present each choosing one of the junior scholars for their CHILD, and
  presenting him with a guinea and a luxurious dinner at this privileged
  table.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. CHILD. Each of the ELECTORS
  (_q.v._) might choose a Scholar on the foundation to attend upon him
  (a nominal duty in recent times) at election time. These were known as
  Warden’s CHILD, Warden of New College’s CHILD, &c. Of late the Head
  Master always chose for his CHILD the head scholar in Cloisters, and
  the Warden the second. Each CHILD received a guinea from the Elector
  who appointed him. The Children got off all fagging on DOMUM DAY
  (_q.v._); at Election Dinner they sat at the same table with Writers
  and Election Grace Singers, where the fare was better than that served
  to the scholars generally; and they had wine and dessert afterwards in
  CHILD’S-room in the Warden’s house. Warden’s CHILD had during the
  following year the duty of applying to the Head Master for every
  REMEDY (_q.v._), and half-remedy that came in the ordinary course. In
  applying he used the set phrase, “The Præpostors’ duty, and they would
  be obliged for a remedy” (or “half-remedy”). Whenever the application
  was something more than a mere form, it was made by the Præfect of
  Hall, _e.g._ where a leave out day disturbed the ordinary arrangements
  of the week.


*Chince* (or *Chinse*), _subs._ (Winchester).—A chance.
    [Apparently a corrupted form of the word.]


*Chinner*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A grin.


*Chip-entry*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  1884. _Stonyhurst Mag._, June, p. 294. The old kitchen was very near
  the site of the present one, but a part of it jutted into what is now
  the end of the Higher Line Washing-place. Just outside this was a
  flight of old oaken steps leading to the refectory. Beyond these
  stairs, leading out to the back, there was a very old round-headed
  oaken door, which is now in the buttery; it is about three hundred
  years old. This was called CHIP-ENTRY.


*Chips*, _subs._ (Wellington).—A kind of grill. [From its
    hardness.]


*Choice*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A candidate in course of trial for
    an Eleven (House or School), and who has not got his CAP
    (_q.v._), FEZ (_q.v._), or FLANNELS (_q.v._).


*Chorister*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quots.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 33. Besides
  the Warden, Fellows, masters, and boys, there were twelve
  “CHORISTERS,” who must by no means be omitted, as they formed an
  important part of the internal economy. I suppose they were called
  CHORISTERS because they had not to sing; certainly if ever that was a
  part of their duty, it had entirely lapsed. Their office was to wait
  on boys, in hall and chambers, till seven o’clock, and especially to
  go on errands in the town,—the boys themselves never being allowed to
  go there, except when invited by friends on Saints’ days. These little
  CHORISTERS wore chocolate-coloured tail-coats and trousers, with metal
  buttons; and, on the whole, I think their life must have been a weary
  one.... _Ibid._, 189. The CHORISTERS really do sing now, and have not
  to run errands in the town for boys, but wait on them in the hall
  instead.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 22. The Bible-clerk meanwhile
  reading aloud a chapter from the Old Testament, the CHORISTERS waited
  at table. An antiphonal grace and psalm were sung, after which the
  CHORISTERS and college servants took their dinner.


*Chouse*, _subs._ (Eton and Winchester).—A shame; an imposition.
    Hence CHOUSER. [A derivative of chouse = trick; swindle:
    _see_ quot. 1890.]

  1864. _Athenæum._ When an Eton boy says that anything is “a beastly
  CHOUSE,” he means that it is a great shame; and when an Eton
  peripatetic tradesman is playful enough to call his customer “a little
  CHOUSER,” he means that a leaf has been taken out of his own book by
  one on whom he has practised.

  1883. BRINSLEY RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_. The boy ... was told
  that what he had done was an awful CHOUSE.

  1890. _Hist. Eng. Dict._ [MURRAY], _s.v._ CHOUSE. “As to the origin of
  the Eng. use, Gifford (1814), in a note on the quot. from Ben Jonson,
  says, ‘In 1609, Sir Robt. Shirley sent a messenger or CHIAUS to this
  country, as his agent from the Grand Signior and the Sophy to transact
  some preparatory business.’ The latter ‘CHIAUSED the Turkish and
  Persian merchants of £4000,’ and decamped. But no trace of this
  incident has yet been found outside of Gifford’s note; it was unknown
  to Peter Whalley, a previous editor of Ben Jonson, 1756; also to
  Skinner, Henshaw, Dr. Johnson, Todd, and others who discussed the
  history of the word. Yet most of these recognised the likeness of
  CHOUSE to the Turkish word, which Henshaw even proposed as the etymon
  on the ground that the Turkish CHIAUS ‘is little better than a fool.’
  Gifford’s note must therefore be taken with reserve.”


*Christians*, _subs. pl._ (Cambridge).—Fellows of Christ’s
    College. [Derivation obvious.]


*Christopher* (Eton).—An old inn in Eton Street.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 23. On the great festivals ... they had permission
  to spend part of the day in a country walk; not without a strong
  caution (so similar are the temptations of schoolboys and the
  anxieties of masters in all ages) against turning into taverns and
  beer-shops by the way. The “Tap” and the CHRISTOPHER had their earlier
  prototypes....


*Chuck*, _subs._ (Westminster). _See_ quot.

  1864. HOTTEN, _Slang Dict._, s.v. A schoolboy’s treat.


*Chucks!* _intj._ (general).—A signal of a master’s approach. A
    French equivalent is _Vesse!_


*Circum.* TO GO CIRCUM, _verb. phr._ (Winchester). _See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 23 [_temp._ 1570]. At five the
  school was dismissed, and the whole resident society—warden, fellows,
  masters, and scholars—went in procession round the cloisters and the
  whole interior circuit of the college, which was called GOING CIRCUM.
  Thus they passed into the hall, where a supper of mutton was
  served—one dispar to every three boys.


*Clacken*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—A wooden bat
    about two feet long with a thin handle and rounded head
    (_e.g._ [Illustration] ), flat on both sides, originally
    used for the game of _hails_. The game is no longer played
    at the school, but survives in the Edin. Academy. [A “Hail”
    in Scotland denotes the place from which a ball is driven
    off at the commencement of a game. “Clacken” is from
    “clack,” the clapper of a mill.]


*Clarian*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A member of Clare Hall,
    Cambridge; also GREYHOUND (_q.v._).

  1889. C. WHIBLEY, _Cap and Gown_. E’en stuke-struck CLARIANS strove to
  stoop.


*Classicus*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A Junior in each PART
    (_q.v._): his duty is to get lessons set, &c.
    CLASSICUS-PAPER = CUSE (_q.v._).


*Clean-straw*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Clean sheets. [Before 1540
    the beds were bundles of straw on a stone floor. At that
    date Dean Fleshmonger put in oaken floors, and provided
    proper beds, such as existed in 1871 in Third, and later in
    the case of the Præfect of Hall’s unused beds in Sixth. The
    term is never used in reference to mattresses of any kind,
    straw or other.] The dormitory arrangements are now
    thoroughly modernised.


*Clipe*, _verb_ (general).—To tell tales; to “split”; to peach.


*Clodding*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A ceremony of initiation [put
    down by Dr. Wooll, _temp._ 1808-28] performed on those who
    were promoted into the Fifth. They had to run along the
    course of a small gutter which flowed from the cow-sheds
    (_see_ BARN-SCHOOL), through a double line of boys, who
    pelted them with clods of clay moistened in that not very
    delicate stream. Unpopular boys had these clods specially
    hardened for their benefit—it was even said with stones
    inside. On promotion from the Fourth to the Remove a boy
    had to run the gauntlet up and down the big school between
    a double line of his fellows, armed with handkerchiefs
    tied in “Westminster knots.” He was allowed to protect
    himself with books stuffed inside his trousers; but the
    punishment was fearful.—COLLINS.


*Cloister-peals*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ PEALS.


*Cloister-roush*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 117. We
  had some singular customs at the commencement of Cloister time. Senior
  part and Cloisters, just before the entrance of the Masters into
  School, used to engage in a kind of general tournament; this was
  called CLOISTER-ROUSH.


*Cloisters*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The name given to Middle and
    Junior Part of Fifth BOOK (_q.v._), when combined together
    in CLOISTER-TIME (_q.v._).

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 24. But the younger commoners
  probably seldom came into school, being taught chiefly in the chamber
  of the warden or fellow under whose charge they were placed; and in
  summer-time the whole of the scholars usually adjourned for lessons
  into the adjacent CLOISTERS: a delightful arrangement, from which the
  latter portion of the “long-half” is still called CLOISTER-TIME.


*Cloister-time*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Ten or twelve weeks at
    the latter end of Long Half, commencing about Whitsunday and
    ending at STANDING-UP WEEK (_q.v._).


*Clow*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Pronounced _clō_. A box on the
    ear. [Possibly from _clout_. HALLIWELL, _clow_ (Cumberland)
    = to scratch. Also _clew_ (Glouc.) = a blow.] Also as
    _verb_: it was customary to preface the action by an
    injunction to “hold down.”

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 140. The
  juniors did not get much fun out of the regular games, as their part
  consisted solely in kicking in the ball, and receiving divers kicks
  and CLOWS in return for their vigilance. _Ibid._, p. 39. Nor, when
  ordered to “hold down” (_i.e._ put your head in a convenient position)
  for a CLOW, would the victim dare to ward off the blow.


*Club-keeper*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A Captain of the side in a
    game: at cricket or football.

  1820-5. WORDSWORTH [_Letter_, 1889]. The old ground which we played
  upon was too much upon a slope, and when I was one of the
  CLUB-KEEPERS, and head of the eleven, a considerable sum was spent in
  endeavouring to improve it, and we succeeded in levelling a sufficient
  space for a tolerably good wicket.


*Coach*, _subs._ (formerly University and Public Schools: now
    common).—A private tutor; and in a transferred sense one who
    trains another in mental or physical acquirements: _e.g._ in
    Sanskrit, Shakspeare, cricket, or rowing. Analagous terms
    are CRAMMER, FEEDER, and GRINDER. Also as _verb_ = to
    prepare for an examination by private instruction; to train:
    in general use both by coacher and coachee.

  1846. THACKERAY, _Vanity Fair_, ch. v. The superb Cuff himself ...
  helped him on with his Latin verses, COACHED him in play-hours.

  1850. F. E. SMEDLEY, _Frank Fairleigh_, ch. xxix. p. 240. Besides the
  regular college tutor, I secured the assistance of what, in the slang
  of the day, we irreverently termed a COACH.

  1853. C. BEDE, _Verdant Green_, pt. I., pp. 63-4. “That man is Cram,
  the patent safety. He’s the first COACH in Oxford.” “A COACH,” said
  our freshman in some wonder. “Oh, I forgot you didn’t know college
  slang. I suppose a royal mail is the only gentleman COACH _you_ know
  of. Why, in Oxford a COACH means a private tutor, you must know; and
  those who can’t afford a COACH, get a cab, _alias_ a crib, _alias_
  translation.”

  1864. _Eton School-days_, ch. ix. p. 103. Lord Fitzwinton, one of the
  smallest and best COACHES—in aquatics—in the school.

  1870. _London Figaro_, June 10, “Quadrille Conversation.” It is, we
  fear, Quixotic to hope that ladies and gentlemen invited to the same
  ball would COACH with the same master.

  1871. _Times_, “Report of the Debate in House of Lords on University
  Test Bill.” The test proposed would be wholly ineffective; ... while
  it would apply to the college tutors, who had little influence over
  the young men, it would not affect the COACHES, who had the chief
  direction of their studies.

  1889. _Pall Mall Gazette_, 29th Nov., p. 1, col. 3. The schoolmaster
  is concerned with the education of boys up to eighteen; all beyond
  that falls either to the COACH or the professor.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 15. Our COACH is always finding
  fault with me.


*Coaching*, _subs._ (Rugby: obsolete).—A flogging.


*Coat.* TO GET ONE’S COAT, _verb. phr._ (Harrow).—To be made a
    member of the “Sixth Form Game”; the equivalent of the
    “Twenty-two” at other schools: cricket.


*Cob*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A hard hit at cricket; a slogger: a
    recent introduction. Also as _verb_ (common), to detect; to
    catch.

    _Verb._ 1. (Stonyhurst).—To purloin oranges, &c., after a DO
    (_q.v._): _e.g._ “COB for me,” sometimes whispered by an
    envious disappointed one to a fortunate friend as he goes
    into the “Do-room.”

    2. (Harrow).—In the verbal sense of COB = to detect; to
    catch (_see_ subs., _ante_); the practice at Harrow is
    almost always to use the word in the passive, with “badly”:
    _e.g._ “I was badly COBBED ‘tollying-up’” (_q.v._).


*Cock*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—An elevation from which, at
    football, a GUARDER (_q.v._) kicks balls which “go out”: it
    corresponds to the “tee” at golf.

    TO BE COCKED UP, _verb. phr._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ quot.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 85. Fags [at Old Charterhouse] had to fag
  in reality at cricket; they got COCKED UP if they cut, and they got
  COCKED UP if they missed a catch, or muffed a ball. A stump was always
  handy.


*Cock-house*, _subs._ (general). A champion house; as at
    cricket, football—anything.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 95. (Harrow) The various Houses are
  divided into “Upper Round” Houses (being those which possess a member
  of the School Eleven at the beginning of the term), and “Lower Round”
  Houses (being those which possess no member of the School Eleven at
  the beginning of the term). The “Upper Round” Houses are drawn
  together, and play against each other; and the same course is pursued
  with regard to the “Lower Round” Houses. When all these ties are
  played off, the winner of the “Upper Round” plays the winner of the
  “Lower Round” for COCK-HOUSE. A silver challenge cup is presented to
  the COCK-HOUSE of the year.

  1898. WARNER in _Harrow School_, 271. Coming back from the holidays a
  boy will eagerly discuss with his comrades the prospects of the term.
  Have they any chance of being “COCK-HOUSE” in football or cricket—and
  no chance is too small on which to build a mighty castle of hope.


*Cockloft, The* (Harrow).—A small room at the top of the Old
    Schools; in turn a school-room or the limbo for the
    SCHOOL-STOCK (_q.v._) of confiscated books.


*Cocks*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—The old washing place. [Early
    in the century a leaden trough, into which six taps
    discharged water, was fixed in a corner of Writing School,
    behind a partition which was constructed to hold Gownboys
    Library. These taps suggested the term COCKS. Formerly
    Gownboys washed at the pump.]


*Cocoa-club*, _subs._ (The Leys).—Afternoon tea, &c., at four in
    winter in House rooms or studies.


*Codd*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ quot.

  1854. THACKERAY, _The Newcomes_. Yonder sit some threescore old
  gentlemen, pensioners of the hospital; ... the Cistercian lads called
  these old gentlemen CODDS.


*Cog.* TO COG ON, _verb. phr._ (Durham).—To swindle; to cheat:
    _e.g._ “TO COG ON marks.” Also TO COCK ON.


*Coke on Littleton*, _subs. phr._ (Eton).—_See_ quot.

  1743. DANIEL WRAY, _Letter_ from Cambridge [quoted in _Etoniana_
  (1865), 70]. One blowing a chafing-dish with a surplice sleeve,
  another warming a little negus or sipping “COKE UPON LITTLETON,”
  _i.e._ tent and brandy.


*Coll*, _subs._ (United Services).—The College.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Nov., p. 345. To deal first with the
  outward appearance of the COLL.—(COLL, be it noted, not College.)
  “That long white barrack by the sea Stares blankly seaward still,”
  sings Kipling in one of his very early poems.


*Collections*, _subs._ (Oxford).—College Terminal Examinations.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, II. viii. Witless men were cramming
  for COLLECTIONS.


*College-John* (Westminster).—The porter and factotum of
    College: invariably so-called, whatever his name may be.


*Colleger*, _subs._ 1. (general).—A square cap; a MORTAR-BOARD
    (_q.v._).

    2. (Eton).—A boy on the foundation as opposed to an OPPIDAN
    (_q.v._).

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Nov., p. 367. The discussion continues as
  to whether the COLLEGERS should compete for the House Cup. As we have
  always said, this seems a ridiculous suggestion. If COLLEGE is on a
  separate foundation to the Oppidans, we can see no reason for them to
  desire to join in competing for Oppidan events.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 14. Parents of independent means rejoice
  when their sons obtain places on the Foundation at Eton. Admitted
  after a severe competitive examination, and specially encouraged in
  the habits of industry, the seventy COLLEGERS generally win a large
  proportion of the prizes and other distinctions that are offered to
  Etonians, and maintain the high reputation of their old school in the
  class lists at Oxford and Cambridge.


*College-ware*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Crockery that falls
    without breaking.—MANSFIELD.


*Combie*, _subs._ (University).—The “Combination room,” a
    parlour in which college dons drink wine after Hall.


*Come.* COME UP! _intj._ (Sherborne).—The order given by the
    Captain of the Games, after 3 Roll on a half-holiday, to
    start the games at football.


*Come-up*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A regulation as to the
    conditions by which one player might try to take the ball
    from another: football.


*Commoner*, _subs._ (general).—A boy not on the foundation.
    Whence (Winchester) COMMONERS = the building they lived in.
    [Now abolished as a residence and converted into class-rooms
    with a handsome library. The old building, which presented
    externally (_vide_ MANSFIELD) the appearance of an inferior
    workhouse, was successfully altered by Mr. BUTTERFIELD, and
    is now, in its architecture, worthy of its purpose and
    surroundings.]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 26. Of the fellow-commoners,
  or COMMONERS, as they are now termed, who have so increased as to form
  a supplementary body of scholars doubling in number the College boys
  themselves, it will be necessary to give some account. Provision had
  been made in the original statutes for the reception and instruction
  of independent students to the number of ten, sons of noblemen or of
  “special friends” of the College, who, though not claiming the other
  advantages of the foundation, might yet wish to avail themselves of
  its sound teaching; with a proviso that these should not be in any way
  burdensome to the revenues.... In [Dr. Burton’s] time the College rose
  rapidly as a place of education for many of the young nobility, and
  the accommodations were found insufficient. He built what is now
  remembered by Wykehamists of the past generation as “OLD COMMONERS.”
  ... The number of COMMONERS gradually increased, until in 1820 they
  reached 135. “OLD COMMONERS” was pulled down in 1839-41 to make way
  for the present building, which was the result of a general Wykehamist
  subscription. _Ibid._, 115 [Westminster]. In every public school the
  masters were entirely dependent for any income beyond their statutable
  salaries on the liberality of the parents of those boys who were
  admitted as COMMONERS, or oppidans. _Ibid._, _Etoniana_, 10. [At Eton]
  there were two classes of these boys—“_generosorum filii
  Commensales_,” and simple “_Commensales_”—corresponding to the
  “gentleman-COMMONER” and “COMMONER” of Oxford; the former probably of
  higher social rank, paying more for their commons, and dining at a
  separate table.


*Commoner-grub*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A dinner formerly given
    by COMMONERS (_q.v._) to College after cricket matches.


*Commoners-speaking*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The day on which the
    speakers, selected from among the INFERIORS (_q.v._),
    declaimed.


*Common Innings*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A form of
    cricket.


*Common-time*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The Short Half, and
    beginning of Long up to Easter time.


*Commons*, _subs._ (University).—Rations of bread, butter, and
    milk, supplied from the buttery. [When a number of men
    breakfast together, the student whose rooms are the
    rendezvous tells his scout the names of those _in_-college
    men who are coming to breakfast with him. The scout then
    collects their COMMONS, which thus forms the substratum of
    the entertainment. The other things are of course supplied
    by the giver of the breakfast, and are sent in by the
    confectioner. As to the knives and forks and crockery, the
    scout produces them from his common stock.]

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, viii. Of course you’d like to take out
  an æger, sir; and I can bring you your COMMONS just the same.


*Compo*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—The championship
    competition in the gymnasium, or at fives; place-kicking.


*Compositions*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—Three days coming at the
    end of each quarter, during which the composition work of
    the various Forms is tested. According to the results is
    arranged the “Order of Compositions,” which is accepted as
    fixing a boy’s place in his Form for the ensuing quarter.
    There is a hill some distance from the College known as
    “Composition Hill,” so called because the Poets (_q.v._)
    went there for inspiration on composition days. The first
    and second boys according to the order of Compositions are
    known respectively as “Roman Imperator” and “Carthaginian
    Imperator.” The last Compositions of the year used to be
    known as the “Great Compositions.” By them the Form medals,
    &c., were decided.


*Compound-kish* (or *Hish*), _subs._ (Marlborough).—The rules of
    the Latin compound sentence.


*Compul*, _adj._ and _adv._ (Harrow).—That is, “compulsory.”


*Compulsory*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ RUNABOUT.


*Con*, _subs._ 1. (Winchester).—A rap on the head with the
    knuckles, or with anything hard, such as a cricket ball.
    Also as _verb_: to rap with the knuckles. [The derivation
    formerly accepted at Winchester was κονδυλον = a knuckle,
    but the editors of the _Wykehamist_ suggest its origin in
    the North Country _con_, “to fillip,” with which the French
    _se cogner_ exactly corresponds.]

    2. (general).—That is, “construe.” Hence TO GET A CONSTRUE =
    to get some one to translate a piece.


*Conduct*, _subs._ (Eton).—A chaplain.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 163. I was stopped on my entry
  into school by the “Minos.” The title of “CONDUCT,” by which the
  chaplains of Eton College are known, was for many years ludicrously
  misprinted by the successive editors of Horace Walpole’s Letters, who
  made him talk of “standing funking over against a conduit to be
  catechised.”


*Conduit*, _subs._ (Winchester).—(1) In College, a water-tap;
    (2) in Commoners, a lavatory.


*Continent*, _adv._ (Winchester).—Ill; on the sick-list: _cf._
    ABROAD. [From _continens cameram vel lectum_.] Hence
    CONTINENT-ROOM = a sick-chamber.

  1605. SHAKSPEARE, _Lear_, i. 2. I pray you have a CONTINENT
  forbearance; ... if you do stir abroad, go armed.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 146.
  When a boy felt ill, or inclined to quit school for a period, he had
  to get leave CONTINENT, which was done by sending a boy in the morning
  first to get leave from his tutor, and then from the Head Master.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, p. 224. We suggested the “CONTINENT room”;
  and on being required to say what was to become of the sick boys?
  replied, that it was notorious that there was never anything the
  matter with them!

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” I
  remember that I have to get “LEAVE CONTINENT” for one of the fellows,
  _i.e._ he wants to be “æger for the day” (“continent,” of course =
  “keeping indoors,” being confined to “sick house” or the infirmary). I
  have to ask leave from the senior præfect in chambers, the præfect of
  hall, the second master, and the head-master, whom I waylay going to
  chapel.


*Cool* (or *Cool-kick*), _subs._ (Eton).—A kick at football with
    no one near. Also as _verb_ = to kick hard.


*Copus*, _subs._ (University).—A wine or beer cup: commonly
    imposed as a fine upon those who talked Latin in Hall, or
    committed other breaches of etiquette. [Dr. Johnson derives
    it from _episcopus_, and if this be correct it is doubtless
    the same as BISHOP.]


*Copy*, _subs._ (Harrow).—An asterisk: _e.g._ as placed on the
    broadsheet against the name of any boy who comes out top of
    his division in any subject; three COPIES secure a prize in
    Speech-room. _See_ Appendix.


*Corn* (The), _subs._ (Oxford).—Cornmarket Street.


*Corner*, _intj._ (The Leys).—Look out! Clear the way!
    [Originally shouted as a warning by boys cycling about the
    buildings on approaching a corner.]


*Corner-monitor*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The monitor in turn at BILL
    (_q.v._) to keep line and preserve order generally.


*Corps-board*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The Rifle Corps notice-board.


*Cosh*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—A caning. Also as _verb_
    = to cane. A rarer word is TANK (_q.v._).


*Cots*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot. [A corruption
    of “cotton.”]

  1810. CHARLES LAMB, _Recollections of Christ’s Hospital_ [1835], p.
  24. The COTS, or superior Shoe Strings of the Monitors.


*Coup*, _verb._ 1. (Durham).—To upset: in frequent use on the
    river. [North dia. COUP = to empty or overset.]

    2. (Stonyhurst).—At BANDY (_q.v._), to lift the ball from
    the ground by means of the crook of the stick.


*Course*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Duty: in _rota_. IN COURSE = on
    duty. [COURSE-KEEPER (obsolete) = a Commoner who drew up a
    table of fagging duties.—WRENCH.]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_, 206. COURSE-KEEPER,
  an office in the patronage of the Commoner Præfects, the duties of
  which were principally connected with the organisation of the fagging
  department. He was required to have been three years in the school, to
  be of reasonable bodily strength, and in Middle Part. His privileges
  were numerous, the principal being that he was allowed to fag. When he
  ascended into Senior Part his duties ceased, but his privileges
  remained; he was then called EX-COURSE-KEEPER.


*Court, The* (Stonyhurst).—The quadrangle behind the College
    Towers; now more commonly called the Quadrangle.
    [“Quadrangle” was one of the names which puzzled the
    Claimant in the famous Tichborne Trial. _Cf._ _Times_
    reports; also _Stonyhurst Magazine_, vol. i. p. 294, and
    vol. ii. p. 317.]


*Courts*, _subs._ (Sherborne).—The school quadrangles: the
    earliest known use of the term is at the end of the
    sixteenth century.


*Cowshed*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital). _See_ Appendix.

  _c._ 1890. _More Gleanings from_ THE BLUE, 84. Time was when it was
  looked upon as a sacred duty on the first Sunday of each term to
  introduce Hertford boys to those three stones in the Ditch which
  represent the toffee man, to show them his six little children, his
  brush and comb, his windmill, and whatsoever else belonging to him the
  imaginative youth can discern in the bare stones under the COWSHED, as
  it is called. Those “sermons in stones” belonged essentially to
  Sunday.


*Cow-shooter*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A “deer-stalker”
    hat: worn by Præfects and CANDLE-KEEPERS (_q.v._).


*Coxy*, _adj._ (general).—Stuck up; conceited; impudent. [COXY =
    conceited (Warwickshire).—HALLIWELL.]

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, p. 202. He’s the COXIEST
  young blackguard in the house—I always told you so. _Ibid._, p. 214.
  “Confoundedly COXY those young rascals will get if we don’t mind,” was
  the general feeling.

  1882. F. ANSTEY, _Vice Versâ_, ch. iv. “Now then, young Bultitude, you
  used to be a decent fellow enough last term, though you were COXY. So,
  before we go any further—what do you mean by this sort of thing?”


*Coy*, _adv._ (Sherborne).—Shy.


*Crackle* (or *Crackling*), _subs._ (University).—The velvet
    bars on the gowns of the JOHNIAN “HOGS” (_q.v._). [From a
    resemblance to the scored rind on roast pork.] The covered
    bridge between one of the courts and the grounds of John’s
    is called the Isthmus of Suez (Latin _sus_, a swine).

  1885. CUTHBERT BEDE, in _Notes and Queries_, 6 S., xi. 414. The word
  CRACKLE refers to the velvet bars on the students’ gowns.


*Cram*, _subs._ (general).—An adventitious aid to study; a
    translation; a crib. As _verb_ = to study at high pressure.
    Hence, CRAMMER = a COACH (_q.v._); a GRINDER (_q.v._); and
    CRAMMING = studying hard.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantab._, s.v.

  1812. Miss EDGEWORTH, _Patronage_, ch. iii. Put him into the hands of
  a clever grinder or CRAMMER, and they would soon cram the necessary
  portion of Latin and Greek into him.

  1825. HONE, _Every-Day Book_, Feb. 22. Shutting my room door ... and
  CRAMMING Euc.

  1841. _Punch_, vol. i. p. 201, col. 1. Aspirants to honours in law,
  physic, or divinity, each know the value of private CRAMMING.

  1844. _Puck_, p. 13. Though for Great Go and for Small, I teach Paley,
  CRAM and all.

  1853. BRADLEY (“C. Bede”), _Verdant Green_, pt. II. p. 68. The
  infatuated Mr. Bouncer madly persisted ... in going into the school
  clad in his examination coat, and padded over with a host of CRAMS.

  1863. CHARLES READE, _Hard Cash_, i. p. 16. “All this term I have been
  (‘training’ scratched out and another word put in: c—r oh, I know)
  CRAMMING.” “CRAMMING, love?” “Yes, that is Oxfordish for studying.”

  1869. SPENCER, _Study of Sociology_, ch. xv. 574 (9th ed.). And here,
  by higher culture, I do not mean mere language-learning, and an
  extension of the detestable CRAMMING system at present in use.

  1872. BESANT AND RICE, _My Little Girl_. The writer of one crushing
  article CRAMMED for it, like Mr. Pott’s young man.

  1872. _Evening Standard_, Aug. 16. “The Competition Wallah.” The
  CRAMMER follows in the wake of competitive examinations as surely as
  does the shadow the body.

  1872. _Daily News_, Dec. 20. Competitive examinations for the public
  service defeated in a great measure the object of their promoters,
  which was to place rich and poor on an equality, because success was
  made to depend very largely on successful CRAMMING, which meant a
  high-priced CRAMMER.


*Crib*, _subs._ (general).—A surreptitious aid to study. Also as
    _verb_.

  1841. _Punch_, i. 177. CRIBBING his answers from a tiny manual ...
  which he hides under his blotting-paper. _Ibid._, 185. He has with a
  prudent forethought stuffed his CRIBS inside his double-breasted
  waistcoat.

  1855. THACKERAY, _Newcomes_, ch. xxii. I wish I had read Greek a
  little more at school, ... when we return I think I shall try and read
  it with CRIBS.

  1856. T. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, pt. II. ch. vi. Tom, I
  want you to give up using vulgus books and CRIBS. _Ibid._, ii. 3. Two
  highly moral lines ... which he CRIBBED entire from one of his books.

  1889. _Globe_, 12th Oct., p. 1, col. 4. Always, it seems likely, there
  will be men “going up” for examinations; and every now and again, no
  doubt, there will be among them a wily “Heathen Pass-ee” like him of
  whom Mr. Hilton speaks—who had CRIBS up his sleeve, and notes on his
  cuff.


*Crick, The* (Rugby). _See_ quot.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 182. THE CRICK is the most celebrated of
  all school runs. Everybody, I fancy, in the running world has heard of
  it. On a day at the end of the Christmas term—generally on the first
  Thursday in December—you may see all the School assembled at the “Quad
  gates.”... THE CRICK is only run once a year. Its course is along
  roads and footpaths to Crick village, and then back by Hillmorton, the
  finish being a length of about a third of a mile along the Hillmorton
  Road. It is a race pure and simple; and is in this respect a race
  against time.... The length of the race is supposed to be about eleven
  or twelve miles, and the time in which it is run is generally between
  an hour and twenty minutes and an hour and a half.


*Cricket-bill*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A “call-over” on the
    cricket-ground. All fall into line, down which a master goes
    noting the number of those absent as stated by the SHEPHERDS
    (_q.v._).


*Cricket-Quarter*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ LONG QUARTER.


*Croc*, _subs._ (Cheltenham).—A ladies’ school when walking out.


*Crocketts*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A kind of bastard cricket,
    sometimes called “small CROCKETTS.” A stump was used and a
    fives ball, with a bat of plain deal about two inches broad,
    or a broomstick. TO GET CROCKETTS = to fail to score; to get
    a “duck’s egg.” _Cf._ BOOKS.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 122. The
  more noisily disposed would indulge in ... playing Hicockolorum, or
  CROCKETTS.


*Cropple*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To pluck; to plough—UP TO Books.
    [_Wykehamicé_ for _cripple_.]


*Cross.* TO BE CROSSED, _verb. phr._—For not paying term bills
    to the bursar (treasurer), or for cutting chapels, or
    lectures, or other offences, an undergrad. can be CROSSED at
    the buttery, or kitchen, or both, _i.e._ a CROSS is put
    against his name by the Don, who wishes to see him, or to
    punish him.

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_, pt. II. ch. x.
  Sir!—You will translate all your lectures; have your name CROSSED on
  the buttery and kitchen books; and be confined to chapel, hall, and
  college.


*Crow*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A master. [From the black gown
    with “wings.”]


*Crown* (Charterhouse).—The school tuck-shop.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 96. At Old Charterhouse the word CROWN,
  with a sort of coronet above it, was painted in large white letters on
  a wall near the racket courts. The story is that the Crown Inn once
  stood just outside this wall.... When the inn was pulled down, Lord
  Ellenborough, then a boy in the school, painted a crown on a wall near
  the place where the inn had stood. Years after, on his return from
  India, being touched to find his boyish work still in existence, he
  expressed a hope that it might never be allowed to vanish; so it has
  been painted again from time to time, and Merchant Taylors’ still keep
  it fresh. This “CROWN” was not near the tuck-shop, which was a grimy
  cellar under the old school, with the face of a disused clock for a
  signboard, and the superscription, “NO TICK HERE.” But it was thought
  fit that the memory of this old word should be kept up somehow and
  somewhere at the new school, so a large theatrical-looking crown was
  suspended, like a tavern sign, outside the school tuck-shop in the
  pavilion. In this way the name and memory of this bit of antiquity are
  preserved.


*Crow Wood* (Stonyhurst).—A wood in the Park.

  1884. _Stonyhurst Mag._, June, p. 294. The churn was in the latter
  days [1834] turned by a wheel worked by water supplied from the CROW
  WOOD.


*Crug*, _subs._ 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—At Hertford, a crust; in
    the London school, crust and crumb alike.

  1820. LAMB, _Elia_ (_Christ’s Hospital_) [_Works_ (1852), 322]. He had
  his tea and hot rolls in a morning, while we were battening upon our
  quarter of a penny loaf—our CRUG.

    2. A BLUE (_q.v._); especially an “old boy.”

  1877. BLANCH, _Blue-Coat Boys_, p. 80. All CRUGS will well remember,
  &c.


*Cruganaler*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—A biscuit given on
    St. Matthew’s Day. [Orthography dubious. Blanch inclines to
    the following derivation: “The biscuit had once something to
    do with those nights when bread and beer, with cheese, were
    substituted for bread-and-butter and milk. Thence the
    term ‘crug and aler.’ The only argument against this is
    the fact that the liquid was never dignified with the
    name of ale, but was invariably called ‘the swipes.’ By
    another derivation = ‘hard as nails.’ It is then spelt
    CRUGGYNAILER.”] Obsolete.


*Cruggy*, _adj._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Hungry. [From CRUG
    (_q.v._).]


*Crump*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A hard hit; a fall. Also as
    _verb_.


*Cud*, _adj._ 1. (Winchester).—Pretty; handsome. [A suggested
    derivation is from κυδος; another is the A.S. _cuð_, the
    Scots _couthie_, and whence _cuðle_, to cuddle (a derivative
    of _cuð_), the meaning formerly given to a verbal usage of
    CUD at Winchester.]

    2. (Christ’s Hospital).—Severe. Whence CUDDY = hard:
    difficult; said of a lesson. Also _Hertfordicé_ for
    PASSY (_q.v._). [There is a common hard biscuit called a
    “cuddy-biscuit” which doubtless has this derivation.]
    Obsolete.


*Culminate*, _verb_ (University: obsolete).—To mount a
    coach-box.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_, s.v.


*Cup-fag*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A boy whose duty it is to
    place the challenge cups, should his House have any, in
    their cases each morning, and remove them to a safe place
    every night. He has also to keep them clean, and for neglect
    of any of these duties he is fined. He receives a quarterly
    payment for his services, and is exempt from other forms of
    fagging.


*Curtain.* ABOVE THE CURTAIN, _phr._ (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 108. A curtain formerly was
  drawn across the school, dividing the upper forms from the lower. One
  day a boy was so unlucky as to tear it; and Busby’s known severity
  left no doubt of the punishment that would follow. The offender was in
  despair, when a generous schoolfellow volunteered to take the blame
  upon himself and suffered in his friend’s stead accordingly.... In
  three year’s time he was sufficiently advanced to be admitted by Busby
  ABOVE THE CURTAIN—that is, into the fourth class, the lowest in the
  upper school. Of this class, however, he says the head-master “took
  little or no care,” but as he rose into the higher forms he found the
  teaching more satisfactory.


*Cuse*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A book in which a record is kept
    of the “marks” in each division; a CLASSICUS PAPER (_q.v._):
    also used for the weekly order.


*Custos*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The official who looks after all
    arrangements in the way of stationery, &c., keeps the keys,
    cuts names on the House-boards, &c.

    Also _see_ ADMONISHING-MONEY.


*Cut*, _verb_ (general).—To avoid; to absent oneself from:
    _e.g._ TO CUT LECTURE, TO CUT CHAPEL, TO CUT HALL, TO CUT
    GATES. _See_ Appendix.

    TO CUT INTO, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—Originally to hit
    one with a “ground ash.” The office was exercised by
    Bible-clerks upon a man kicking up a row when up to Books.
    Now generally used in the sense of to correct in a less
    formal manner than TUNDING (_q.v._).

    TO CUT IN A BOOK, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866). CUT IN A
  BOOK.—A method of drawing lots. A certain letter was fixed on (_e.g._
  the first in the second line on the left page), each boy then turned
  over a leaf, and whoever turned over the leaf in which the
  corresponding letter was nearest to A, won.


*Cuts*, _subs._ (general).—Flannel trousers; SHORTS (_q.v._).






*Dab*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The entrance examination: held at the
    beginning of term.

    To be a DAB = to be skilled at anything. Hence, the two
    entrance examinations, one at the end of term, and the other
    at the very beginning of the next, are the SKEW (_q.v._) and
    the DAB respectively. The DAB offers no second chance; hence
    a bad candidate tries the “skew” first.


*Dame*, _subs._ (Eton).—A mathematical or other master (except a
    classical) who keeps a boarding-house for boys in College.
    Also (obsolete) at Harrow. _See_ Appendix, and quot. 1867.

  1786-1805. TOOKE, _Parley_, 390, s.v. BATTEL. A term used at Eton for
  the small portion of food which in addition to the College allowance
  the Collegers receive from their DAMES.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 133. Formerly these [boarding] houses were almost
  entirely kept by “DAMES” or “Dominies”—the latter being the old style
  when there was a male head of the establishment, though now the term
  “DAMES” applies to all without reference to sex. Tutors and
  assistant-masters used to live in most of these houses, but had no
  charge over the boys. Only the lower master and some of the senior
  assistant-masters kept houses of their own. There are now twenty
  boarding-houses kept by masters, and ten by “DAMES”—of whom four only
  are ladies.

  1866-72. “MAC,” _Sketchy Memories of Eton_ (1885). I am thankful to
  say that I did not attend the show. But I happened to see the World
  conducted back to his DAME’S, and the spectacle was gruesome. The
  punishment inflicted had been very considerable, and I do not think
  the World appeared in public for quite a fortnight.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_ [Harrow], p. 293. All these
  [sixteen boarding-houses other than the head-master’s] are kept by
  assistant-masters, and form one considerable source of their income.
  No DAMES’ boarding-houses are now sanctioned; and for the good order
  of his establishment each master is responsible.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 16. Until recently some of the
  boarding-houses were kept by assistant-masters, the remainder by
  “dominies” or “DAMES,” who took no part in the work of education, and
  had little or no disciplinary jurisdiction. The boys, therefore, who
  boarded in DAMES’ houses had as their tutors assistant-masters
  residing elsewhere. Now, although there remains only one female DAME,
  the teachers of mathematics, science, and French are for some purposes
  accounted DAMES.


*Damnation-corner*, _subs._ (Eton).—_See_ quot., and
    DAMNATION-HILL (Appendix).

  1866-72. “MAC,” _Sketchy Memories of Eton_ (1885). Meanwhile,
  “regardless of our doom, we little victims played,” or rather watched
  the play; we little knew what cruel fate awaited us, or that the
  present head-master of Eton and the Rev. F. W. Cornish lay in ambush
  for our outcoming behind that very sharp turn in the High Street,
  which, on account of its acute angle, and the consequent danger of
  being nailed in shirking in old days, was somewhat flippantly termed
  DAMNATION-CORNER.


*Dancing Gallery, The* (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The old name of
    the Picta Gallery.

  1884. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 290. The gallery now known as “Our Lady’s
  Gallery,” which in former times was designated THE DANCING GALLERY. It
  is by competent judges pronounced to be one of the finest bits of
  “Baronial Gothic” architecture in England, but the door is quite a
  solecism, for it is of a much later design.


*Dark Walk, The* (Stonyhurst).—A long avenue of tall yew trees
    in the garden. Tradition says the last of the Shireburns was
    poisoned by eating some of the berries from these trees.
    _Cf._ _Stonyhurst Mag._, ii. 179; iv. 703.

  1885. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 179. The DARK WALK formerly extended a
  considerable way nearer the house than now, and when the Jesuits came
  it was found necessary to encroach upon the gardens to make room for
  the playgrounds, and a certain part of the DARK WALK was taken in.


*Darker* (Harrow).—The photographic “dark-room”: formerly under
    the Science Schools.


*Dark-lanthorn* (Harrow).—_See_ JACK-O’-LANTERN.


*Date-card*, _subs._ (Haileybury).—_See_ quot.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 297. Besides the ordinary forms of
  punishment, there is the DATE-CARD, of which refractory or forgetful
  youths write out selected “twelves.” It is much more useful to know
  “Gutenberg prints from moveable type, 1453,” than to record “Infaudum,
  regina, jubes renovare dolorem.”


*Daviesites* (Charterhouse).—_See_ OUT-HOUSES.


*Day* (Stonyhurst).—Rector’s Day, Provincial’s Day, General’s
    Day—whole holidays given in honour of superiors; in the two
    former instances accompanied by presentations of verses
    written by the boys. [The word “DAY” seems as peculiar as
    “PLACE” (_q.v._). _Cf._ the “Three hundred-day,” given when
    the number of boys first reached three hundred; “Kenna’s
    Day,” on the occasion of the visit of Captain Kenna, V.C.,
    to the College, &c.]


*Day-boys*, _subs._ (Cheltenham).—An exercise on the horizontal

    _i.e._ a boy in the form below the GRECIANS.


*Deputy*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The Junior CANDLEKEEPER
    (_q.v._), who had the organisation of the Fagging
    department, and assisted the Senior CANDLEKEEPER in
    thrashing the Juniors in Hall.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Derrywag*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Paper used for parsing: ruled
    twenty lines down, and six across. [That is, “derivation
    paper.”]


*Deten*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—A card issued to a boy
    set down for Saturday afternoon detention. Also called a
    SOUP-TICKET.


*Devor*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Plum-cake. [From the Latin
    verb.]


*Dex*, _subs._ (Loretto).—A form of “small cricket” once
    extremely popular at Loretto. [The name originated with
    Andrew Lang, and was not intended to be complimentary to the
    game. Often called PUDDEX, owing to a mistaken derivation.]


*Dibs* (or *Dobs*), _subs._ (Sherborne).—Prayers.


*Dic*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A dictionary.


*Dinge*, _subs._ (Royal Military Academy).—A picture or
    painting.

  pieces of india-rubber, two pencils, two pieces of sealing-wax, two
  pieces of penstring, two DIPS (little globular ink-bottles), two
  DIP-CORKS, two wedges, two pieces of gutta-percha (for putting on the
  points of foils), and any number of pens. [Contents of a Westminster
  fag’s pocket.]

    2. (Felsted).—An “incandescent” electric lamp. Hence DIP-KEY
    = an electric light switch-key.


*Dispar* (or *Disper*), _subs._ (Winchester).—A portion; a
    share. _See_ quot., and CAT’S-HEAD.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Arch. Words_, s.v. DISPAR ... A commons or share.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 22. Under the superintendence
  of the _præfectus ollæ_ (prefect of tub), portions of beef, called
  DISPARS, were served out to the boys in messes of four, with a
  sufficiency of bread, and beer in large black jacks.


*Distinction-breakfast*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—_See_
    GOOD-BREAKFAST.


*Distinguished*, _adj._ (Stonyhurst).—Said of a boy who obtains
    two-thirds of the marks in any examination. “Distinction” in
    the year’s work wins a prize, and term “distinctions” are
    otherwise rewarded.


*Ditch* (The), _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ Appendix.

  1854. _The Blue_ [quoted in] July 1871. The Steward did not attempt to
  quiet us; he got us out of the Hall as quickly as he could, and we
  rushed to the Treasurer’s house in the DITCH, and cried “Shame” till
  we were tired.


*Ditto-blues*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A suit of clothes all of
    blue cloth.


*Div*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A “division”: _e.g._ TIQUE-DIV
    (_q.v._).


*Do*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A general name for minor and special
    suppers: usually given to some privileged class, or in
    reward for some extra work: e.g. Choir-DO; Magazine-DO
    (given to the staff and contributors to the School
    magazine). _Cf._ GOOD-SUPPER and GOOD-BREAKFAST. Whence
    DO-ROOM = the long room in which a DO is held. [As a rule
    words with the suffix “room” are modern; “PLACE” (_q.v._) is
    the older form.]


*Dock*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To erase: as by rubbing out, or by
    a stroke of the pen; to tear out: as leaves from a book.

    II^{nd} Class.


*Dog-shooter*, _subs._ (Royal Military Academy).—_See_ quot.

  1889. BARRERE, _Slang, Jargon, and Cant_, p. 317. Cadets thus term a
  student who accelerates, that is, who, being pretty certain of not
  being able to obtain a commission in the engineers, or not caring for
  it, elects to join a superior class before the end of the term.


*Dole*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A stratagem; a trick: as
    to get one out of bed. [From Latin _dolus_.]


*Dolifier*, _subs._ (Winchester).—One who contrives a trick.
    _See_ DOLE.


*Dolphin*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A boy who has passed a certain
    examination in swimming and diving: about the fifteen best,
    as a rule, are so named.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, p. 96. On the last Monday of the term
  there is a contest for the best swimmer and the best diver, a
  challenge cup being given for these events by Lord Ebrington. There

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_, 207. DOMUM—a Latin

  to go home for the holidays. The tradition says that he carved it on a
  tree, and then committed suicide. On the last Friday in Long Half,
  after Election, a kind of festival was held in the evening, when
  numbers of people came into College, and DOMUM was sung over and over
  again in School, Meads, and the principal Quadrangle ... at each place
  (p. 183) singing DOMUM louder than before, till at last the power
  failed, and the ladies, visitors, and superannuates went to recruit
  their energies for a brief period before going to the DOMUM-BALL at
  St. John’s rooms.


*Domum-ball*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A ball given by the
    superannuated College Prefects on the evening after the
    “men” go home for the Midsummer holidays.


*Domum-day*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Going-home day at Midsummer.


*Don*, _subs._ (University).—A fellow or officer of a college;
    whence the vulgar usage = an adept; a swell. [From Latin
    _dominus_, a lord, through the Spanish title.]

  1665. DRYDEN, _Indian Emperor_, Epilogue, 21. For the great DONS of
  wit—Phœbus gives them full privilege alone, To damn all others, and
  cry up their own.

  1698-1700. WARD, _London Spy_, pt. XIII. p. 299. Like the Great Old
  DONS of the Law, when they dance the Measures in an Inns-of-Court Hall
  upon the first day of Christmas.

  1730. JAS. MILLER, _Humours of Oxford_, i. p. 7 (2nd ed.). The old
  DONS ... will come cringing, cap in hand, to offer to show the ladies
  the curiosities of the college.

  1826. REYNOLDS (“Peter Corcoran”), _Song on the Fancy_. Dull
  innocence! Twaddle on, Thy weary worshipper—and fain Would give thee
  up, to be a DON, And beat the watch in Drury Lane.

  1855. THACKERAY, _Newcomes_, ch. xi. Does not go much into society,
  except ... once or twice to the houses of great country DONS who dwell
  near him in the country.

  There you are now, ’Arry, I say, ’Arry, by Jove, you are a DON.”

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 11. What the DONS can be about to
  allow boys ... to have a bottle of champagne each, and then “more,” I
  can _not_ understand.


*Dor*, _subs._ (Old Westminster).—_See_ quot. [TO OBTAIN A DOR =
    to get leave to sleep.—HALLIWELL.]

    school. The first double is for morning prayers at 9.30 A.M.

    dinner, when the exercise of those not playing in regular
    games is arranged. [Originally summoned by a double bell.]

    2. (Harrow).—A room shared by one other. _See_ SINGLE.


*Double Puff*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  1886. _Stonyhurst Mag._, iii. 18. DOUBLE PUFF, ... a game played after
  the fashion of “tip and run,” except that instead of a wicket and
  tennis ball a Stonyhurst cricket bat is used, and a ball about the
  size of an ordinary BANDY (_q.v._) ball, made of soft material and
  covered with sheepskin, which made it very hard to hit far, and still
  harder either to catch, or to pick up and throw in.... The distance
  between the wickets is not as long as in wicket cricket; and the rule
  about bowling is the same as in Stonyhurst cricket, namely, under-arm
  and not waiting till the batsman is ready. It used to be played a good
  many years ago on Sunday afternoons, between Vespers and supper; and
  the community used to come out in large numbers to play it.


*Double-ruled*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Punishment paper. [Ruled
    double like a copy-book.]


*Dough*, _subs._ (general).—Pudding.


*Doul*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury and Durham).—A fag. Also as _verb_.
    Obsolete at Durham. _Cf._ DOWLINGS.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_ [Shrewsbury], p. 250. Four boys
  are “put on” by rotation every week as general fags for the head
  common room, whose duties in modern days consist chiefly in fetching
  and carrying. These fags are called DOULS (δουλος) in the classical
  Shrewsbury vernacular.


*Dove*, _subs._ (Cambridge: obsolete).—A member of St.
    Catharine’s College.

  1889. C. WHIBLEY, _Three Centuries of Cambridge Wit_, p. xxix. It is
  said that the members of St. Catharine’s Hall were first of all called
  “Puritans” from the derivation of the name of their patroness from
  καθαίρειν. The “dove” being the emblem of purity, to change a name
  from “Puritans” to DOVES was but one short step.


*Dowlings*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury).—Football.

  1883. PASCOE, _Life at our Public Schools_. There are four or five
  compulsory games a week (football) known as DOWLINGS (δουλος).

    DREEP.”

    day.”


*Drive*, _verb_ (Felsted).—To be late, or nearly late, for a
    roll-call. Also as _subs._: _e.g._ “He did a drive.”

    piece of news is stale: originally DRIVE UP! [The original
    usage.]


*Dry-bob*, _subs._ (Eton).—A boy who goes in for cricket rather
    than boating. _See_ WET-BOB.

  1839. BUCKLAND [_Macmillan’s Mag._ (Nov. 1889), “Eton Fifty Years
  Ago”]. It was the ambition of most boys to be a wet-bob, and to be “in
  the boats.” The school was divided between wet-bobs and DRY-BOBS, the
  former taking their pleasure on the river, and the latter in the
  cricket-field.


*Duchess’ Rooms* (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—A section of the old
    College once inhabited by a Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.

  1885. _Stonyhurst Mag._, ii. 100. The whole of this building ... stood
  in what is now the back court.... It was entirely of wood and plaster,
  in the style denominated “post and pattern.” The Duchess of Norfolk,
  the last of the Shireburns, daughter of Sir Nicholas, resided in it,
  hence the name of THE DUCHESS’ ROOMS by which it was last known. She
  faced the front of the wooden building with stone, and inserted sash
  windows, a style then coming into fashion.


*Dubs*, _adj._ (Winchester).—Double.


*Duck*, _subs._ 1. (Winchester).—The face. TO MAKE A DUCK = to
    grimace. [DUCK (var. dial.) = to bow.]

    2. (Felsted).—A school matron.

    3. (Harrow).—One of the House swimming four, upwards of
    sixteen. Whence DUCKLING = one under sixteen.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, p. 96. “Ducker” is open all the summer
  term, and for two weeks after the boys go back in September. For those
  who care for swimming there are inter-House swimming matches; and each
  House elects DUCKS (boys over sixteen) and DUCKLINGS (boys under
  sixteen) to compete for Cock-House.


*Ducker, The* (Harrow).—The school bathing-place beyond the
    Footer Fields: the largest artificial open-air bathing place
    in England. Originally the DUCK-PUDDLE. [Probably the first
    example of the “-ER” terminations: it is at least forty
    years old.]

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 322. Bathing was always, until
  very lately, practised under difficulties at Harrow. The common
  bathing-place, known as DUCK-PUDDLE ... was a long piece of muddy
  water, varying from four to eight feet in depth. There, after it had
  been stirred up by all possible means into more of a puddle than
  usual, new boys were formally dipped.... To avoid mixing in the
  general wash at DUCK-PUDDLE, many boys used to go out to the Brent at
  Perivale, or even as far as Ellestree reservoir, for bathing; and
  these were favourite expeditions on the mornings of Saints’ days. But
  Dr. Vaughan had the old “puddle” lined with brick, and supplied with
  water by a steam-engine, to the great additional comfort of the
  bathers.


*Ducks*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Football knickerbockers. [Made of
    white “duck.”]


*Dump*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To extinguish: as a candle. _Ex._
    DUMP the TOLLY (_q.v._). [_Dump_ (Devon) = to knock heavily;
    to stump.]


*Dungeons.* MEET YOU IN THE DUNGEONS, _phr._ (Royal High School,
    Edin.).—A challenge to fight. _See_ CALTON, and CAMPUS
    MARTIUS.


*Dusthole*, _subs._ (Cambridge: obsolete).—Sidney Sussex
    College.






*Early* (or *Late*) *Play*, _subs._ (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 186. Besides the regular
  weekly half-holidays, there are others specially granted, known as
  EARLY and LATE PLAYS. The latter, given by the head-master at his
  discretion, consists in the remission of all school work after eleven
  A.M. But an EARLY PLAY—when school is “up” at nine—is a much more
  formal indulgence, accorded by very ancient custom only to the
  personal request of some visitor of distinction. St. David’s Day
  (March 1st) and St. Patrick’s (March 17) have always been holidays of
  this class: for the former, the late and the present Sir Watkin Wynn
  have always come down to Westminster; and for the latter, the late
  Marquess of Lansdowne (as an Irish peer) and Sir Everard Home. The
  custom, even now observed on some occasions, was for the visitor’s
  arrival at the gate to be formally announced to the head-master by
  Monos, who received a “tip” for his services. The master at once “came
  down school,” and reappeared through the great door, accompanied by
  the hero of the day, who was received by the boys with great
  demonstrations of welcome, expressed by the vigorous rapping of books
  on the desks. Both knelt down side by side, while the “monitor of
  school,” kneeling immediately in front of them, proceeded with the
  usual school prayers. The visitor then “begged a play,” which was
  granted. The applause was renewed, and acknowledged by a bow, after
  which the whole of the boys rushed joyously down school, the masters
  following in more grave and stately fashion. The visits of the “King
  of North Wales” were doubly popular, since he presented every Welsh
  boy with a sovereign—a custom which the present baronet liberally
  continues.


*East.* _See_ WISE MEN OF THE EAST.


*Ecky*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar).—Exercise.


*Egg* (or *Egg-up*), _verb_ (Marlborough).—To show ostentatious
    zeal. Whence EGGER (_subs._) and EGGY (_adj._).


*Egg-flip Day*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The Founder’s
    Commemoration Day. [Because a favourite beverage at the
    festivities succeeding the great annual football match
    played on that day between the “first sixes” of Commoners
    and College was “Egg-flip.”]


*Eggotty*, _adj._ (Felsted).—Used as follows: A boy seen
    carrying an egg or eggs, if addressed by another as
    “EGGOTTY,” might, must in fact, almost in honour, throw an
    egg at him. If the egg-owner was a good shot he would invite
    his friend “call me EGGOTTY.”


*Eight*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The school Shooting EIGHT: also the
    Gym. EIGHT.


*Election*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The examination of Præfects
    and Senior Part for New College, and of candidates for
    admission to Winchester.

    _Intj._ (Westminster).—A fag-call.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 164. From about 8 to 10 he
  [the fag] is supposed to be at work, in a sort of common room assigned
  to the juniors collectively, preparing his lessons for next day; but
  the call of “ELECTION,” which signifies that the services of one of
  the junior election is required by one of the seniors, used to be
  frequent enough to be a very serious interruption. It is admitted that
  these demands upon a junior’s time have commonly been such that “a boy
  tempted to be idle, as most of them are, finds very considerable
  difficulty in doing his work.” In order to check these interruptions
  as far as possible, a late regulation has made all fagging unlawful
  during these evening hours of work.

    TO GAIN A YEAR BY ELECTION, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—A boy
    not being a FOUNDER (_q.v._) was obliged to leave at the
    Election immediately succeeding his eighteenth birthday; he
    whose birthday came shortly after Election, was thus enabled
    to stay till he was nearly nineteen, and was so said “to
    gain a year.”—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Electors*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The Warden and two Fellows of
    New College, and the Warden, Sub-Warden, and Head-master of
    Winchester, who conducted ELECTION (_q.v._).—MANSFIELD (_c._
    1840).


*Elegant Extracts*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—Students who, though
    “plucked,” were still given their degrees. A line was drawn
    below the poll-list, and those allowed to pass were
    nicknamed the ELEGANT EXTRACTS. There was a similar limbo in
    the honour-list.


*Elements*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The first Form.


*End*, _subs._ 1. (Winchester).—A table or division of a table
    in College Hall, practically meaning “mess.”—WRENCH.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 208. END.—At
  dinner-time the INFERIORS (_q.v._) were divided into six companies,
  each being presided over by a _Candlekeeper_ (_q.v._). These companies
  and the table at which they sat were called ENDS.

    2. (Felsted).—_See_ TIP.


*English*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A translation; an adventitious
    aid to study; a crib.


*Ensign* (Eton).—_See_ MONTEM.


*Enterta*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—An entertainment.


*-er*, _inseparable suffix_ (Harrow).


*Erasmus.* GREAT (or LITTLE) ERASMUS FORM, _subs. phr._
    (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  1834. TROLLOPE, _History of Christ’s Hospital_. THE GREAT AND LITTLE
  ERASMUS FORMS get their respectable and respective titles from the
  fact that their tenants in old time studied the larger and smaller
  Colloquies of the learned Erasmus.

  1870-95. _More Gleanings from_ THE BLUE, 191. THE GREAT ERASMUS.—The
  origin of a name is seldom what one thinks it ought to be. Those of us
  who rejoice in being able to write after our names the mystic letters,
  L.E._x._, L.E._y._, L.E._z._, are distinguished from our less
  fortunate neighbours by the lightning fluency with which we are able
  to talk secrets in Greek. ERASMUS is a Greek word, and the Dutchman,
  thanks to a visit to Oxford, became so great a scholar in Greek, that
  he was appointed first Regius Professor of Greek in the University of
  Cambridge.... Unfortunately, this is all wrong as far as the LITTLE
  ERAS. are concerned, for they were not called ERAS. because they knew
  Greek, but because they read Latin.... Erasmus did a kindness to
  Christ’s Hospital long after his death in having written a number of
  “Colloquies,” conversations between typical characters of his day, in
  clear and faultless Latin.


*Ewe-lamb*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A school hour in which a Master
    or Prefect has no appointed lesson.


*Ex*, _subs._ (Harrow).—(1) An exercise of any sort; and (2) an
    EXEAT (_q.v._). Also (Charterhouse) in sense 2, but _not_
    EXTRA, sense 3 (_q.v._).


*Ex-Course-keeper*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ COURSE-KEEPER.


*Exeat*, _subs._ 1. (general).—Written permission to go away
    from School or College either at the end or during the term
    for a longer period than a day. _Cf._ ABSIT.

  1886. DICKENS, _Dict. of Cambridge_, 3. No undergraduate should go
  down without obtaining his EXEAT.

    2. (Charterhouse).—An interval in the middle of each of the
    three terms of the school year; it was instituted so that
    there might be no leaving at odd times. It lasts from noon
    on Saturday to 6.45 P.M. on the following Monday. Formerly
    Upper School had a GOING-OUT SATURDAY every week, and the
    Under School one every other week, and leave lasted from
    noon on Saturday till Sunday evening chapel. Also at Harrow
    a similar term of leave.


*Exercises*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete).—Ordinary Form
    lessons, not merely written work: seventeenth century.


*Explain.* DON’T EXPLAIN! _intj._ (The Leys).—An injunction to
    silence; “Shut up!”


*Extra*, _subs._ (Harrow).—1. Extra school on Tuesdays, when
    those SENT (_q.v._) copy out Latin grammar for two hours and
    a half: an extreme punishment.

    2. (Harrow).—An extra day’s BOY (_q.v._): given to those who
    CUT (_q.v._) when “on boy.”

    3. (Charterhouse).—Extra school: it lasts from 2 to 4 every
    Wednesday afternoon. The ways of procuring admission to it
    are various: to neglect a REP (_q.v._) or a “construe,” to
    be late for anything, to make a noise in the cubicles, to
    come into school in slippers, or any misdemeanour leads to a
    boy being “down for EXTRA.” The entries are kept in ... THE
    BLACK BOOK. EXTRA school is for offences committed during
    the first part of the week. There is also EXTRA drill on
    Saturdays in Scholars’ Court, which lasts half the time of
    EXTRA school, and which is much more disliked, for offences
    committed between a Thursday and a Saturday.


*Extra Drill*, _subs._ (The Leys).—Imposed by way of punishment.


*Ex Trumps*, _adv. phr._ (Winchester).—Extempore. TO GO UP TO
    BOOKS EX TRUMPS = to go to class without preparing one’s
    lesson.






*Fag*, _subs._ 1. (general).—A boy who does menial work for a
    schoolfellow in a higher Form. [From FAG, to grow weary.]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 37. The
  duties of a FAG, in the days of which I write, may be more easily
  described by informing the reader what he had not to do, than by
  endeavouring to make out a list of his positive duties. I believe when
  I say that he had not to make the beds, nor to clean shoes, I have
  exhausted the negative catalogue.

  1855. THACKERAY, _Newcomes_, ch. xviii. Bob Trotter, the diminutive
  FAG of the studio, who ran on all the young men’s errands, and fetched
  them in apples, oranges, and walnuts.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, vii. These were the principal
  duties of the FAGS in the house. From supper until nine o’clock three
  FAGS taken in order stood in the passages, and answered any præposter
  who called “Fag,” racing to the door, the last comer having to do the
  work. This consisted generally of going to the buttery for beer and
  bread and cheese (for the great men did not sup with the rest, but had
  each his own allowance in his study or the fifth-form room), cleaning
  candlesticks and putting in new candles, toasting cheese, bottling
  beer, and carrying messages about the house.... And besides this
  nightwork, each præpostor had three or four fags specially allotted to
  him, of whom he was supposed to be the guide, philosopher, and friend,
  and who in return for these good offices had to clean out his study
  every morning by turns, directly after first lesson and before he
  returned from breakfast.

  1857. G. A. LAWRENCE, _Guy Livingstone_, ch. i. Is still enumerated
  among the feats of the brave days of old, by the FAGS over their
  evening small beer.

    2. (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  1850. L. HUNT, _Autobiography_, ch. iii. FAG, with us [at Christ’s
  Hospital] meant eatables. The learned derived the word from the Greek
  _phago_, to eat.

    3. (Stonyhurst).—A fielder: at cricket. Also FAGGER.

    4. (Stonyhurst).—A bore.

    _Verb._ 1. (general).—To do menial work for a schoolfellow
    in a higher Form. Hence FAGGER, FAG-MASTER, FAGGING, and
    FAGGERY.

  1853. DE QUINCEY, _Autob. Sketches_, i. 210. FAGGERY was an abuse too
  venerable and sacred to be touched by profane hands.

  1873. _Pall Mall Gazette_, 17th May. The Winchester “tunding” system,
  with all its faults, is hardly less objectionable than the FAGGING
  system pursued in the Scotch endowed hospitals.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75. As I was smaller and weaker than most
  of the FAGS running, I hardly ever managed to get a place, and it was
  absurd to expect me to do so. I had been “spanked” two or three times
  already for failing, but I don’t know that I was more successful for
  that. I know I cordially detested that branch of FAGGING.

  1884. _Temple Bar_, August, p. 514. He must have completely marred his
  chance of happiness at the school when he refused to FAG and took
  countless thrashings, snivelling.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 46. My new FAG-MASTER, Forker
  Major, is a beast.

    2. (Stonyhurst).—To field: at cricket. The ordinary meaning
    either as _subs._ or _verb_ does not exist at Stonyhurst.


*Fag-book*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Formerly a book given by a
    monitor on leaving to each of his fags: it is now usual to
    give a bat or a racket.


*Fain lo!* (or *Loss*), _intj._ (Felsted).—A phrase used to
    retain a seat, &c., temporarily vacated. Also LO.


*Fains* (*Fainits!* or *Fain it*), _intj._ (general).—A call for
    truce during the progress of a game without which priority
    of place would be lost; generally understood to be demanded
    “in bounds,” or when out of danger. [Thought to be a
    corruption of “fend.”]

    _Verb_ (also FEND, FAIN, FAINITS, &c.).—A cry of warning, or
    of prohibition: as to prevent any change in the existing
    conditions of a game; _e.g._ at marbles, FEN-PLACINGS =
    no alteration in position of marbles is permissible;
    FEN-CLEARANCES = removal of obstacles is forbidden. [FEND =
    _M.E. defend_ in sense of “to forbid.”] FAIN, and FAIN I,
    are corruptions. At Winchester, FINGY YOU, or FINGY THAT,
    are analagous; but at Christ’s Hospital FIN = “I won’t
    have.”

  _Ante_ 1815. E. C. HARRINGTON, in _N. and Q._, 5 S., vii. 98.
  Respecting the word FEN ... I can testify to the use of the term by
  school-boys prior to the battle of Waterloo ... meaning that we
  protested against an exceptional action.

  1852. DICKENS, _Bleak House_. “I’m fly,” says Jo. “But FEN larks, you
  know.”

  1877. _Notes and Queries_, 5 S., vii. 178. A comical application was,
  I remember well, “FEN live lumber!” which, if pronounced in time,
  would disable your opponent from moving a bystander out of the way of
  his shot.


*Fardel*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A division of Sixth
    Book for New College Election. [A.S. _ferthe_ = the fourth,
    and _del_, a part or portion.]

  1200. _Orminn._ The FEORRTHE DALE was bitahht (delivered) to Pilate.

  1283. _William of Palerne._ Non might sen other the FERTHE DEL of a
  furlong.


*Faside*, _subs._ (Loretto).—To Faside Castle, and back:
    altogether about five miles. Boys who have been watching
    football matches have always to do this in wet weather; and,
    in bad weather, a WALLYFORD (_q.v._). Whence FASIDE AND
    THREE TREES = a combined walk and run about seven miles on a
    short school-day not wet, when ground is unsuitable for
    games. [Why THREE TREES is unknown.] _See_ GRIND-DAYS.


*Fat-flab*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A cut off the fat part of a
    breast of mutton. _See_ DISPAR.


*Feeder-cric*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—The game
    usually known as “rounders.” _See_ Appendix.

  1874. _The Blue_, Mar. In the country we shall have real unlimited
  cricket in the place of rounders, FEEDER-CRIC, and the scanty
  bi-weekly game in the suburbs.


*Fellow-commoner*, _subs._ (general).—_See_ quots., and
    COMMONER.

  1794. _Gent. Mag._, p. 1084. One [student at Cambridge] was a _Harry
  Soph_; another a FELLOW-COMMONER and _senior Soph_, and occasionally
  jocularly called an _empty bottle_, whilst _è contrà_, a bottle
  decanted, was, from time to time, denominated a FELLOW-COMMONER.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 26. Thomas Middleton petitions
  King Charles, on his restoration, to grant his royal letters to the
  Winchester electors in favour of his son’s admittance “as a child in
  Winchester College, where he has now spent three years as
  FELLOW-COMMONER.”

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 38. She said she had heard from
  her cousin, who is, I think, a FELLOW-COMMONER, or something of that
  sort, at Downing College, that Harry is one of the most popular men at
  Cambridge.


*Feoffee*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar: obsolete).—The original
    name for the trustees in whose hands the foundation
    estate was placed by Hugh Bexwycke. [A.S. _feo_ = fee or
    inheritance.]

    in swimming.

    2. (Harrow).—_See_ LICK.

    3. (Eton).—_See_ WALL.

    THE FIELD, _subs._ (Sherborne).—_See_ FIELDS.


*Fields*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete).—The playing-ground:
    seventeenth century. The modern term is “The Field,” though
    there are five separate grounds.


*Fifteens*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A football match. _See_
    SIX-AND-SIX.


*Fifty, The*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—The chief football ground;
    the next immediately below it is the Middle Fifty, then the
    Lower Fifty, and the Fourth Fifty. _Cf._ HUNDRED, which is
    now obsolete.


*Fighting-green*, _subs._ (Westminster).—The old battle-ground
    in the western cloister.


*Figures*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The Second Form: formerly GREAT
    FIGURES. _See_ LITTLE FIGURES.

    _See_ FAINS.


*Find*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A mess of, usually, two upper boys
    which takes breakfast and tea in the rooms of one or other
    of the set: a privilege of the Sixth Form. Whence FIND-FAG =
    a fag who lays the table for the upper boys. [_Find_ (dial.)
    = to supply; to supply with provisions.] Also as _verb_.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 316. Immediately a certain
  number of rolls (FINDS they were called—etymology unknown) were
  ordered at the baker’s, and were rebaked every morning until they were
  pretty nearly as hard as pebbles. At nine o’clock on the morning fixed
  for the rolling in, the members of the hall ranged themselves on the
  long table which ran along one side of the room, each with his pile of
  these rolls before him, and a fag to pick them up.


*Finder*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A waiter.

  1283. _William of Palerne._ Thei bisiliche fondede (tried) fast to
  FERKE him forthward.

  _c._ 1400. _Troy Book._ I you helpe shall the flese for to fecche, and

  1599. SHAKSPEARE, _Henry V._, iv. 4. _Pistol._ I’ll fer him, and FIRK

  1611. BARRY, _Ram Alley_ [DODSLEY, _Old Plays_ (REED), v. 466]. Nay, I
  will FIRK my silly novice, as he was never FIRK’D Since mid-wives
  bound his noddle.

  1640. BROME, _Antipodes_. As tumblers do ... by FIRKING up their

*Flannels*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The members of either School
    Eleven.

  1852. BRISTED, _Five Years in an English University_, p. 12. Somehow I
  nearly FLOORED the paper.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iv. Mr. Filcher thoroughly understood
  the science of “FLOORING” a freshman.

  1861. HUGHES, _Tom Brown at Oxford_. I’ve FLOORED my Little Go.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 98. These blessed exams. are
  getting awfully close now, but I think I shall FLOOR mine.


*Fluke*, _verb_ (general).—To shirk.

  1864. _Eton School-Days_, ch. xvi. p. 203. “By Jove! I think I shall
  FLUKE doing Verses; I should like to see Paddy drive tandem through
  College,” said Butler Burke.


*Flyer*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A half-volley at football. A
    MADE-FLYER is when the bound of the ball is gained from a
    previous kick, by the same side, against canvas or any other
    obstacle, or is dropped, as in a “drop-kick.” This is now
    confused with a “kick-up.”—WRENCH.


*Flying-man*, _subs._ (Eton).—The boy who stands behind the
    “bully,” and either runs down, or kicks hard, as may be
    required.

  1864. _Eton School-Days_, ch. xxiii. p. 255. He possessed good wind,
  and was a very good “kick-off,” and he could “bully” a ball as well as
  any one. He was a little too heavy for FLYING-MAN, but he made a
  decent “sidepost,” and now and then he officiated as “corner.”


*Fobs*, _subs._ (Durham: obsolete).—Boiled bread and milk.


*Footer*, _subs._ (Harrow).—(1) Football; (2) a player of
    football according to Rugby rules; and (3) the ball itself.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, p. 96. Directly after the goose match
  (Michaelmas Day) FOOTER proper begins, and is the principal game
  played at the school during the Christmas term. The game as played at
  Harrow differs considerably from the game as played at Eton and other
  schools, and has distinct rules of its own; it may be said to be more
  like the Association game than any other.

  1896. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 139. H. H. H. who wants to have a
  “second” FOOTER shirt.

    recently obtained his colours.


*Forakers* (or *Foricus*), _subs._ (Winchester).—The

*Force.* OUT BY FORCE, _phr._ (Stonyhurst).—Of a football when
    it goes out from two opposite players at the same time.


*Founders*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Boys who proved their descent
    from the Founder, and were afterwards elected (by rote among
    the Electors) as such. Only two were admitted each year, and
    only two were sent to New College, but these two were put at
    the head of the ROLL (_q.v._) whatever their previous
    position in SIXTH BOOK (_q.v._) might have been. They were
    not obliged to leave at the age of eighteen, as the other
    boys were, but were allowed to remain till they were
    twenty-five. They were supposed to have particularly thick
    skulls.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Founder’s-Com.*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The four days on which
    there were festivals in commemoration of the Founder, when
    there was AMEN-CHAPEL (_q.v._); the Fellows and Masters gave

    a sovereign each.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Founder’s-day*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The 3rd of October, the
    anniversary of the death of John Lyon: usually kept on the
    nearest Thursday to the date in question.


*Founder’s-kin*, _subs._ (various).—Those, who at Winchester,
    Harrow, &c., could show descent from William of Wykeham or
    John Lyon, &c., as the case might be, and who were entitled
    to priority of election on the foundation.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 32. The preference assigned to
  FOUNDER’S-KIN in the election soon brought into the field, as may be
  supposed, young Wykehams and Williamses from all quarters, with others
  who proved more or less satisfactorily their connection with the
  founder’s family; and gradually the customs obtained of electing two
  only of these favoured candidates at the head of the roll for
  admission, and filling up the remaining vacancies by a process of
  successive nominations by each of the six electors, the Warden of New
  College having the first turn, until the number of vacancies was
  supplied.


*Founder’s-Ob.*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The anniversary of the
    Founder’s death.

*Fourth*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A rear or jakes. [Origin
    uncertain; said to have been first used at St. John’s or
    Trinity, where the closets are situated in the Fourth
    Court. Whatever its derivation, the term is now the only
    one in use at Cambridge, and is frequently heard outside
    the university.] The verbal phrase is TO KEEP A FOURTH.


*Fourth Book*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—All the boys
    below Junior Part the Fifth. _See_ BOOKS.

*Fourth of June* (Eton).—_See_ quot.

  1865. _Etoniana_, p. 166. Since the glories of Montem have departed,
  the FOURTH OF JUNE PROCESSION has taken its place as the great yearly
  festival of Etonians. It was instituted in commemoration of a visit of
  King George III., and is held on his birthday. It is the great
  trysting day of Eton, when her sons gather from far and wide, young
  and old, great and small,—no matter who or what, so long as they are
  old Etonians; that magic bond binds them all together as brothers, and
  levels for the time all distinctions of age or rank. The proceedings
  begin with the ‘speeches’ delivered in the upper school at twelve
  o’clock before the provost, fellows, masters, and a large audience of
  the boys’ friends. Selections from classical authors, ancient or
  modern, are recited by the Sixth-form boys, who are dressed for the
  occasion in black swallow-tail coats, white ties, black knee-breeches
  and buckles, silk stockings, and pumps. Then follows the provost’s
  luncheon, given in the college hall to the distinguished visitors,
  while similar entertainments on a smaller scale are going on in the
  various tutors’ and dames’ houses. At 3 o’clock there is full choral
  service in chapel. At 6 o’clock all hands adjourn to the Brocas, a
  large open meadow, to witness the great event of the day,—the
  procession of the Boats to Surly Hall, a public-house of that name, on
  the right bank of the river, some three and a half miles from Windsor.
  The boats are divided into two classes—Upper and Lower. The Upper
  division consists of the _Monarch_ ten-oar, the _Victory_, and the
  _Prince of Wales_, or, as it is more usually called, the _Third
  Upper_. The Lower boats are the _Britannia_, _Dreadnought_, _Thetis_,
  and _St. George_; sometimes, when the number of aspirants to a place
  is larger than usual, an eighth boat called the _Defiance_ is added.
  The collegers have also for some years put on a four-oar—latterly
  expanded into an eight—which follows in the procession. The flotilla
  is preceded by the Eton racing eight-oar, manned by the picked crew
  who are to contend at Putney or Henley. Each boat has its distinctive
  uniform. Formerly these were very fanciful—Greek pirates, or galley
  slaves in silver chains, astonishing the quiet reaches of the Thames
  for the day. The crews of the Upper boats now wear dark blue jackets
  and trousers, and straw hats with ribbons, displaying the name of the
  boat in gold letters. The coxswains are dressed in an admiral’s
  uniform, with gold fittings, sword, and cocked-hat. The captain of
  each boat has an anchor and crown embroidered in gold on the left
  sleeve of his jacket. In the Lower boats, the crews wear trousers of
  white jean, and all ornaments and embroidery are in silver. Each boat
  carries a large silk flag in the stern. The procession is headed by a
  quaint old-fashioned boat (an Eton racing boat of primitive days)
  rowed by watermen and conveying a military band. The Westminster eight
  always receives an invitation to this celebration, and occasionally
  makes its appearance on the river, adding very much to the interest of
  the procession.... Opposite to Surly Hall, a liberal display of good
  things ... awaits the arrival of the crews—the Sixth Form alone being
  accommodated with a tent. After a few toasts, and as much champagne as
  can be fairly disposed of in a short time, the captain of the boat
  gives the word for all to re-embark, and the flotilla returns to Eton
  in the same order.... Singing, shouting, racing, and bumping, all go
  on together in the most harmonious confusion.... The boats, after
  their return through Windsor Bridge, turn and row two or three times
  round an eyot in the middle of the stream above the bridge. During
  this time a grand display of fireworks takes place on the eyot. The
  ringing of the fine old bells in the Curfew Tower, the cheering of the
  crews, and the brilliant coloured fires which strike across the water,
  and light up the dense masses of spectators along the bridge, the
  rafts, and the shore, produce an effect not easily forgotten. A
  pyrotechnic illumination of the College arms concludes the ceremonies,
  and is the signal for the crews to land and march in jubilant disorder
  back to College.

    ACTION.


*Fragment*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A dinner for six
    (served in College Hall, after the ordinary dinner), ordered
    by a Fellow in favour of a particular boy, who was at
    liberty to invite five others to join him. A fragment was
    supposed to consist of three dishes.—_Winchester Word-Book_
    [1891].

    because it is frequented by FRESHMEN (_q.v._).


*Fresh-herring*, _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—A boy newly
    admitted to the school. Such a one is seized on his first
    or first few visits to the playground, and conveyed to a
    corner—a MONKEY DEN—where he is more or less forcibly
    SQUABBED (_q.v._) against the wall by as many persecutors
    as can get at him. The incongruity of fresh-herrings in a
    monkey-den does not seem to be remarked. But twenty-five
    to thirty years ago FRESH-HERRINGS were hurled over _the
    Precipice_. This was a drop of some six or eight feet from
    the general level of the playground over a retaining wall
    to the bottom of an incline up which coal-stores, &c.,
    could be brought into the playground. The new science and
    art rooms have covered the site, and MONKEY-DEN has
    superseded the terrors of this local Tarpeian Rock. The
    FRESH-HERRING is always told that he must bring beeswax
    and turpentine for the purpose of polishing his desk, and
    he not infrequently comes armed with this or some other
    form of furniture-polish, to the glee of the “stuffer-up.”


*Freshman* (or *Fresher*), _subs._ (University).—A University
    man during his first year. In Dublin University he is a
    JUNIOR FRESHMAN during his first year, and a SENIOR FRESHMAN
    the second year. At Oxford the title lasts for the first

  a FRESHMAN in Cambridge.

  1650. HOWELL, _Familiar Letters_ [NARES]. I am but a FRESHMAN yet in
  France, therefore I can send you no news, but that all is here quiet,
  and ’tis no ordinary news, that the French should be quiet.

  1671. COTGRAVE, _Wit’s Interpreter_, p. 221. First, if thou art a
  FRESHMAN, and art bent To bear love’s arms, and follow Cupid’s tent.

  said the Doctor, “and he is only a FRESHMAN, having lost every
  examination.”

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iii. Mr. Green saw at a glance that
  all the passengers were Oxford men, dressed in every variety of Oxford
  fashion, and exhibiting a pleasing diversity of Oxford manners. Their
  private remarks on the two new-comers were, like stage “asides,”
  perfectly audible. “Decided case of governor!” said one. “Undoubted
  ditto of FRESHMAN!” observed another.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 55. A lot of FRESHMEN got together
  after Hall (it was a Saints’ day, and they’d been drinking audit) and
  went and made hay in Marling’s rooms.

  1891. _Sporting Life_, Mar. 20. The mile, bar accidents, will be a
  gift to B. C. Allen, of Corpus, who has more than maintained the
  reputation he gained as a FRESHER.

  1895. _Felstedian_, Dec., 178. The new trousers and immaculate brown
  boots of the “FRESHER” are suffering terribly from the slush.

  were entertaining some fifteen or more FRESHERS.

*Fudge*, _subs._ 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—To copy; to crib; to
    dodge or escape: also _see_ quot.

  1870-95. _More Gleanings from_ THE BLUE. The Latin Grammar was a
  strange book to the new boy; he says he was “relieved from
  embarrassment by the readiness with which my schoolfellows in the
  class above assisted in explaining,” &c. &c.; so a “FUDGE” is not a
  modern invention, though it is expressed by a polite periphrasis.

  1877. _The Blue-Coat Boys_, p. 97. FUDGE, to prompt a fellow in class,
  or prompt oneself in class artificially. Thence to tell: _e.g._ “FUDGE
  me what the time is.”

    2. (common).—To advance the hand unfairly at marbles.

    candlestick, used for the night-light in College Chambers.

  window yawned the great fireplace, with its dogs, on which rested the
  faggots and bars for the reception of the array of boilers. Above it
  was a rushlight, fixed in a circular iron pan fastened to a staple in
  the wall; it was called the FUNCTIOR.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. FUNCTURE. The word looks
  like _fulctura_, an earlier form of _fulture_, meaning a prop or stay,
  with phonetic change of _l_ into _n_.


*Funking-Monday*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  1887. _The Blue_, Nov. Yet it is not from ignorance of vulgar slang
  that the author’s elegance springs, for he unbends once so far as to
  say that the Monday after the holidays is called “FUNKING-MONDAY.”


*Funking-room*, _subs._ (medical).—The room at the Royal College
    of Surgeons where students collect on the last evening of
    their final during the addition of their marks, and whence
    each is summoned by an official announcing failure or
    success.

  1841. _Punch_, i. p. 225, col. 2. On the top of a staircase he enters

*Funkster*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A coward.


*Furk.* _See_ FIRK.






*Gag*, _subs._ 1. (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot. GAG-EATER = a
    term of reproach.

  1813. LAMB, _Christ’s Hospital_, in _Works_, p. 324 (ed. 1852). L. has
  recorded the repugnance of the school to GAGS, or the fat of fresh
  beef boiled; and sets it down to some superstition.... A GAG-EATER in
  our time was equivalent to a ghoul, ... and held in equal estimation.

    2. (Winchester: obsolete).—An exercise (said to have been
    invented by Dr. Gabell) which consists in writing Latin
    criticisms on some celebrated piece, in a book sent in about
    once a month. In the Parts below Sixth Book and Senior Part,
    the GAGS consisted in historical analysis. [An abbreviation
    of “gathering.”]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 108.
  From time to time, also, they had to write ... an analysis of some
  historical work; these productions were called GATHERINGS (or GAGS).

    School, Edin.).—The first, or lowest class. _See_ CATS.

*Gang*, _subs._ (Felsted: obsolete).—A particular friend. From
    the ordinary meaning of the word, applied first to the two
    friends, then to each of them. Used only of “acute”
    friendship. Also as _verb_ = to carry on such a friendship
    with another.


*Garden, The* (Stonyhurst).—The playgrounds, built on the site
    of part of the old garden, long kept this name. “The boys
    went to the GARDEN” = “into the playground”: obsolete.


*Gater*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A plunge head foremost
    into a POT (_q.v._).


*Gates*, _subs._ (University).—The being forbidden to pass
    outside the gate of a college. Hence as _verb_ = to confine
    wholly or during certain hours within the college gate for
    some infraction of discipline. To BREAK GATES = to stay out
    of college after hours. GATE-BILL (old) = the record of an
    undergraduate’s failure to be within the precincts of his
    college by a specified time at night.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cant._, p. 128. To avoid GATE-BILLS he will be out at
  night as late as he pleases ... climb over the college wall, and fee
  his gyp well.

  kindly holding either arm Staunch the dark blood and GATE him for the
  term.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, I. ch. xii. He won’t hurt you much,
  Giglamps! GATE and chapel you!

  1861. HUGHES, _Tom Brown at Oxford_, ch. xii. Now you’ll both be GATED
  probably, and the whole crew will be thrown out of gear.

  1865. _Cornhill Mag._, p. 227. He is requested to confine himself to
  college after a specified hour, which is familiarly termed being
  GATED.

  1870. _Morning Advertiser_, May 23. The two least culpable of the
  party have been GATED.

  1881. LANG, _Xxxii. Ballades_, “Of Midsummer Term.” When freshmen are
  careless of GATES.

    TO BE AT GATES, _verb. phr._ (Winchester: obsolete).—To
    assemble in Seventh Chamber passage, preparatory to going
    Hills or Cathedral.


*Gaudeamus*, _subs._ (general).—A feast; a drinking bout; any
    sort of merry-making. [German students’, but now general.
    From the first word of the mediæval (students’) ditty.]


*Gaudy* (or *Gaudy-day*), _subs._ (general).—A feast or
    entertainment: specifically, the annual dinner of the
    Fellows of a college in memory of founders or benefactors;
    or a festival of the Inns of Court. [Lat. _gaudere_ = to
    rejoice.]

  1540. PALSGRAVE, _Acolastus_ [HALLIWELL]. We maye make our tryumphe,
  kepe our GAUDYES, or let us sette the cocke on the hope, and make good
  chere within dores. _Ibid._, I have good cause to set the cocke on the
  hope, and make GAUDYE chere.

  1608. SHAKSPEARE, _Antony and Cleopatra_, iii. 11. Come, Let’s have
  one other GAUDY night; call to me All my sad captains; fill our bowls;
  once more Let’s mock the midnight bell.

  1636. SUCKLING, _Goblins_ [DODSLEY, _Old Plays_ (REED), x. 143]. A
  foolish utensil of state, Which, like old plate upon a GAUDY day, ’s
  brought forth to make a show, and that is all.

  1724. E. COLES, _Eng. Dict._ GAUDY DAYS, college or Inns of Court
  festivals.

  1754. B. MARTIN, _Eng. Dict._, 2nd ed. GAUDIES, double commons, such
  as they have on GAUDY or grand DAYS in colleges.

  1760. FOOTE, _Minor_, Act i. Dine at twelve, and regale, upon a GAUDY
  DAY, with buns and beer at Islington.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantab._, p. 122. Cut lectures ... give GAUDIES and
  spreads.

  1820. LAMB, _Elia_ (_Oxford in the Vacation_). Methought I a little
  grudged at the coalition of the _better Jude_ with Simon—clubbing, as
  it were, their sanctities together, to make up one poor GAUDY-DAY
  between them.

  1822. NARES, _Glossary_, s.v. GAUDY DAY or NIGHT. A time of festivity
  and rejoicing. The expression is yet fully retained in the University
  of Oxford. BLOUNT, in his _Glossographia_, speaks of a foolish
  derivation of the word from a judge Gaudy, said to have been the
  institutor of such days. But _such_ days were held in all times, and
  did not want a judge to invent them.

  1822. SCOTT, _Fortunes of Nigel_, ch. xxiii. We had a carouse to your
  honour ... we fought, too, to finish off the GAUDY.

  1878. BESANT AND RICE, _By Celia’s Arbour_, ch. xxxiii. Champagne ...
  goes equally well with a simple luncheon of cold chicken, and with the
  most elaborate GAUDY.


*General’s-day* (Stonyhurst).—_See_ DAY.


*Gentlemen-Philosopher*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—_See_
    PHILOSOPHER.


*Genuine*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Praise. Also as _verb_ = to
    praise. [It is suggested (but _see_ quot.) that the
    derivation may be from _genuina_, the “jaw-tooth,” praise
    being nothing but “jaw”: _cf._ _Parsius_, i. 115.]

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. GENUINE.... He was awfully
  quilled and GENUINED my task. Possibly from calling a thing genuine.
  _Cf._ to blackguard, to lord, &c. But fifty years ago it was a _subs._
  only. [_See_ Appendix.]


*Gip* (or *Gyp*), _subs._ (Cambridge).—A college servant.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 8. My GYP said he thought he knew
  some one who’d give me eighteen shillings for it.


*Girdlestoneites* (Charterhouse).—A boarding-house. [From a
    master’s name.] _See_ OUT-HOUSES.


*Glope*, _verb_ (Winchester: obsolete).—To spit.


*Go.* TO GO DOWN, _verb_ (University).—To leave school or
    college: by special EXEAT (_q.v._) or at vacation. Whence TO
    BE SENT DOWN = to be under discipline; to be rusticated.

  1863. H. KINGSLEY, _Austin Elliot_, i. 179. How dare you say “deuce”
  in my presence? You can GO DOWN, my Lord.

  1886. DICKENS, _Dict. of Cambridge_, 3. No undergraduate should GO
  down without obtaining his EXEAT.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 53. I’m thankful to say this
  Term’s nearly over now.... We shall be able to GO down next week ...
  which is a blessing.

  1898. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” You will
  think, then, that most of us do no work. Well, a good many do precious
  little. Still there is this check. All who do not pass their
  examinations within a certain time must “GO DOWN,” _i.e._ they must
  leave. It wholly depends upon ourselves, then, how much work we do;
  and it is naturally a much more difficult matter to “read” in this way
  than when one has regular schools and studies.


*Goal*, _subs._ (Winchester).—(1) At football the boy who stands
    at the centre of each end, acting as umpire; and (2) the
    score of three points made when the ball is kicked between
    his legs, or over his head, without his touching it. _See_
    SCHITT.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 138.
  Midway between each of the two ends of the line was stationed another
  boy, as umpire (GOAL he was called), who stood with his legs wide
  apart, and a gown rolled up at each foot: if the ball was kicked
  directly over his head, or between his legs, without his touching it,
  it was a GOAL, and scored three for the party that kicked it.


*God*, _subs._ 1. (Eton).—A Sixth Form boy. _See_ Appendix.

  1881. PASCOE, _Life in our Public Schools_. A GOD at Eton is probably
  in a more exalted position, and receives more reverence than will ever
  afterwards fall to his lot.

    2. (Westminster).—The juniors who, at the WESTMINSTER PLAY
    (_q.v._), occupy a back gallery. A proposal was made in 1792
    to exclude them from the performance on the grand nights,
    which, however, was successfully resisted. Whence GOD-KEEPER
    = a Third Election boy, who acts as deputy monitor, and
    keeps the gallery deities in order.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 155. A rushing noise is heard
  as of a party of inebriated whirlwinds coming up College, and the _Di
  Superi_ (in vulgar parlance THE GODS) make their appearance. Now is
  the time to see the GOD-KEEPER in his glory, in kid gloves, cane, and
  commanding voice: “Here, Jones, go up closer. Room for three or four
  more in that corner. Tumble-up, Davis.”


*Going-out Saturday*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ EXEAT 2.


*Gold Hatband*, _subs._ (old University).—A nobleman
    undergraduate; a TUFT (_q.v._).

  1628. EARLE, _Microcosmography_. His companion is ordinarily some
  stale fellow that has been notorious for an ingle to GOLD HATBANDS,
  whom hee admires at first, afterwards scornes.

  1889. _Gentleman’s Mag._, June, p. 598. Noblemen at the universities,
  since known as “tufts,” because of the gold tuft or tassel to their
  cap, were then known as GOLD HATBANDS.


*Golgotha*, _subs._ (old University).—The Dons’ gallery at
    Cambridge; also a certain part of the theatre at Oxford.
    [That is, “the place of skulls” (_cf._ Luke xxiii. 33 and
    Matt. xxvii. 33); whence the pun, Dons being the heads of
    houses.]

  1730. JAS. MILLER, _Humours of Oxford_, Act ii., p. 23 (2nd ed.).
  Sirrah, I’ll have you put in the black-book, rusticated—expelled—I’ll
  have you _coram nobis_ at GOLGOTHA, where you’ll be bedevilled,
  Muck-worm, you will.

  1785. GROSE, _Vulg. Tongue_, s.v.

  1791. G. HUDDESFORD, _Salmagundi_ (Note on, p. 150). GOLGOTHA, “The
  place of a Skull,” a name ludicrously affixed to the Place in which
  the Heads of Colleges assemble.

  1808. J. T. CONYBEARE in C. K. SHARP’S _Correspondence_ (1888), i.
  324. The subject then of the ensuing section is _Oxford News_ ... we

  survives in the Winchester vocabulary.

  the Addenbroke’s hospital to the Blenheim turnpike, all Cambridge was

  shop-boys away in support of their brother townsmen—the battle raged,
  and the GOWN had the worst of the fight.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, II., ch. iii. When GOWN was absent,

    stood with his legs stretched out, and a gown, rolled up

  Cambridge, no longer animated by the countless throngs of GOWNSMEN,

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, III. By the time Mr. Bouncer finished
  these words, the coach appropriately drew up at the “Mitre,” and the
  passengers tumbled off amid a knot of GOWNSMEN collected on the

  1861. HUGHES, _Tom Brown at Oxford_. The townsmen ... were met by the

*Greaser*, _subs._ 1. (Durham: obsolete).—A cad.

  though not fast, Yet his little-go and GREAT-GO, He creditably pass’d.

  for his GREAT GO.

  1883. _Echo_, 3rd May, p. 2, c. 4. But few, indeed, are the men who

    entering and leaving the school: this has been somewhat
    loosely kept, and gaps are conspicuous.


*Green-room Boys*, _subs. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—Boys chosen to be
    the stage-manager’s assistants at the Shrove-tide plays.


*Greens, The* (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—Two large grass plots, or
    lawns and shrubberies, on the south front. A cricket-ball
    hit full pitch into either of these from the opposite end of

    boys who used to look after the “GREENS.”


*Greeze*, _subs._ (Westminster).—A crowd.


*Greyers*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Grey flannel trousers: worn by all

    examination. Also as a _verb_. (2) A plodding student. (3)
    Athletic sports in general: specifically, a training run.
    Also as _verb_ = to teach; to instruct; to coach.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, pt. II. ch. v. “Come along,
  boys,” cries East, always ready to leave the GRIND, as he called it.
  _Ibid._, ch. vii. “The thing to find out,” said Tom meditatively, “is
  how long one ought to GRIND at a sentence without looking at the
  crib.”

  1872. _Chambers’s Jour._, April. Joe Rullock, the mighty gymnasiarch,
  the hero of a hundred GRINDS, the unwearied haunter of the palæstra,
  could never give the lie to his whole past life, and deny his own
  gymnastics.

  1887. _Chambers’s Jour._, 14th May, p. 310. Smalls made just such a
  goal as was required, and the GRIND it entailed was frequently of no
  slight profit to him.

    THE GRIND, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The ferry-boat at
    Chesterton. (Oxford) A diversion popular among the less
    athletic tutors and undergraduates, which consists in
    walking by the Banbury Road to the 2-1/2 mile stone,
    crossing to the Woodstock Road, which is here only a quarter
    of a mile distant, and so returning to Oxford, occasionally
    varying the proceeding by reversing the order of the walk.
    It is, however, probable that the introduction of golf has
    dealt a severe blow at the popularity of this innocent
    amusement. Also THE FIVE MILES GRIND.

    ’VARSITY GRIND (Oxford).—A steeplechase held at Stratton
    Audley.


*Grind-days*, _subs._ (Loretto).—The GRIND-DAYS occur twice a

    train to various places, such as Peebles, Pomathorn, &c.,
    and walk, perhaps about twenty miles, to some other place,
    where they dine, returning by train. Some of the rest cross
    the Pentlands, and the Juniors go up the highest Pentland.


*Grinder*, _subs._ (general).—A private tutor; a COACH (_q.v._).

  1812. Miss EDGEWORTH, _Patronage_, ch. iii. Put him into the hands of
  a clever GRINDER or crammer, and they would soon cram the necessary
  portion of Latin and Greek into him.

  1841. _Punch_, vol. i. p. 201. Then contriving to accumulate five
  guineas to pay a GRINDER, he routs out his old note-books from the
  bottom of his box and commences to read.

  1841. A. SMITH, “The London Medical Student” in _Punch_, i. p. 229. G
  was a GRINDER, who sharpen’d the fools.

  1849. THACKERAY, _Pendennis_, ch. v. She sent me down here with a
  GRINDER. She wants me to cultivate my neglected genius.


*Grinding-mill*, _subs._ (general).—The house of a tutor
    or COACH (_q.v._), where students are prepared for an
    examination.


*Groats.* TO SAVE ONE’S GROATS, _verb. phr._ (old
    University).—To come off handsomely. [At the Universities
    nine groats are deposited in the hands of an academic

    depositor obtains, with honour, are returned to him.—GROSE.]


*Grotius-time*, _subs._ (Winchester).—From 7 P.M. to 7.45 P.M.
    on Sundays, in CLOISTER-TIME (_q.v._) when SIXTH BOOK
    (_q.v._) and SENIOR PART (_q.v._) went into school to
    translate the work of that author.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).
    Now obsolete.


*Groute*, _verb_ (Marlborough and Cheltenham).—To work or study
    hard; to SWOT (_q.v._).


*Grovel*, _subs._ (Sherborne).—A scrummage at football.


*Grubber*, _subs._ (general).—A tuck-shop. _See_ LAMB’S-TAILS,
    ROUND OTHELLOS, KILL-ME-QUICKS, and PICANINNIES.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 441. The shop is privately
  managed by Mr. Kimmins, of High Street, Tonbridge [and] is known as
  “GRUBBER.”


*Grubby*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—The luncheon room.


*Gruff*, _adj._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Low-pitched: of the voice.
    _See_ quot., and SQUEAKY.

  _c._ 1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874].
  The voices, in our own peculiar phraseology, being divided into two
  classes—those who sang “squeaky,” and those who sang GRUFF.


*Guarder*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A goal-keeper: at football.
    Whence SECOND-GUARDER = the “full-back” of Association
    Football; and THIRD-GUARDER = the “halfback” of Association
    Football.


*Gulf*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The bottom of a list of “passes,”
    with the names of those who only just succeed in getting
    their degree. At Oxford a man who, going in for honours,
    only gets a pass. Hence as _verb_ (Cambridge) = to place in
    the GULF; TO BE GULFED = to be on such a list. [Men so
    placed were not eligible for the Classical Tripos.]

  1852. BRISTED, _Five Tears in an English University_, p. 205. Some ten
  or fifteen men just on the line, not bad enough to be plucked, or good
  enough to be placed, are put into the GULF, as it is popularly called
  (the examiners’ phrase is “degrees allowed”), and have their degrees
  given them, but are not printed in the calendar. _Ibid._, 297. I
  discovered that my name was nowhere to be found—that I was GULFED.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, pt. III. p. 89. I am not going to let
  them GULPH me a second time.

  1863. H. KINGSLEY, AUSTIN ELLIOT, p. 123. The good Professor scolded,
  predicted that they would all be either GULFED or ploughed.

  1865. _Sporting Gaz._, April 1. A man who was _GULFED_ for
  mathematical honours was certainly, in olden time, unable to enter for
  the classical examination; but though the arrangement is altered, the
  term is _not_ obsolete. A man who is GULFED is considered to know
  enough mathematics for an ordinary degree, but not enough to be
  allowed his degree in mathematics only; he is consequently obliged to
  pass in all the ordinary subjects (except mathematics) for the “poll,”
  before taking his degree.

  1876. TREVELYAN, LIFE OF MACAULAY (1884), ch. ii. p. 61. When the
  Tripos of 1822 made its appearance, his name did not grace the list.
  In short ... Macaulay was GULFED.

  1896. _Tonbridgian_, No. 339, 1124. Poole hopes to get a Third in
  Honour Mods., and Law hopes to escape a GULF next year in the same.


*Gull*, _subs._ (Oxford: obsolete).—A swindler; a trickster.
    _Cf._ “GULL-CATCHER,” of which it is probably an
    abbreviation.

  1825. _The English Spy_, v. i. p. 161. “You’ll excuse me, sir, but as
  you are _fresh_, take care to avoid the GULLS.” “I never understood
  that GULLS were birds of prey,” said I. “Only in Oxford, sir, and
  here, I assure you, they bite like hawks.”


*Gutter*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—A scrummage at Rugby football:
    now nearly obsolete. [Properly the space between the teams
    in the scrummage.]

    _Verb_ (Winchester).—To fall in the water flat on the
    stomach.


*Gymmy*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar).—The gymnasium.


*Gyp* (or *Gip*), _subs._ (Cambridge).—A college servant. At
    Oxford, a scout; at Dublin, a skip. [Etymology doubtful:
    according to _Sat. Rev._ an abbreviation of Gipsy Joe:
    according to Cambridge undergraduates, from the Greek γυψ
    (GUPS) = a vulture; from the creature’s rapacity.]

  1794. _Gent. Mag._, p. 1085. [A Cambridge college servant is called a
  JIP.]

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantab._, 128. To avoid gate-bills he will be out at
  night as late as he pleases, ... climb over the college wall, and fee
  his GYP well.

  1842. _Tait’s Mag._, Oct., “Reminiscences of Coll. Life.” There is
  attached to colleges and halls a person more useful than ornamental,
  and better known than paid, whom Oxonians name GYP, from his supposed
  moral affinity to a vulture (γυψ). The same is in Dublin denominated a
  _Skip_, because of the activity which is an indispensable item in his
  qualifications.

  1849. C. KINGSLEY, _Alton Locke_, ch. xii. I’ll send you in luncheon
  as I go through the butteries; then, perhaps, you’d like to come down
  and see the race. Ask the GYP to tell you the way.

  1850. SMEDLEY, _Frank Fairleigh_, p. 254. Fellow you call the GYP
  wanted to make me believe you were out—thought I looked too like a
  governor to be let in, I suppose.

  1882. F. ANSTEY, _Vice Versâ_, ch. v. Who should we see coming
  straight down on us but a Proctor with his bull-dogs (not dogs, you
  know, but the strongest GYPS in the college).


*Gyte*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.).—A first year’s
    student.






*Habit*, _subs._ (old University).—See quot.

*Haggory*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—One of the gardens in the
    _Higher Line_ (_q.v._) playground, which the Irish boys in
    the early years of the century turned into a debating-place,
    to promote the views of O’Connell and his party. [A
    corruption of ἁγορά.]


*Hairy*, _adj._ (Oxford).—Difficult.

  _d._ 1861. ARTHUR CLOUGH, _Long Vacation Pastoral_. Three weeks hence
  we return to the shop and the wash-hand-stand-bason, Three weeks hence
  unbury Thicksides and HAIRY Aldrich.

  1864. _The Press_, Nov. 12. HAIRY for difficult is a characteristic
  epithet.


*Half-faggot*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” At
  6.15, when the first bell for chapel rings, I go round and wake up
  everybody; as the præfects like hot water for washing, I make up a
  fire, and put on the boilers; in other words, throw a bundle of sticks
  called a “HALF-FAGGOT” on the old-fashioned “dogs,” or uprights, which
  form the only fireplaces in chambers, coal not being in use.


*Hall*, _subs._ 1. (Oxford).—Dinner. Also as _verb_ = to dine.
    [Taken in College Hall.]

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 55. A lot of Freshmen got together
  after HALL (it was a Saint’s day, and they’d been drinking audit) and
  went and made hay in Marling’s rooms.

    2. (Sherborne).—Evening preparation.

    3. (Shrewsbury).—_See_ SENIOR HALL.

    TO GO ON HALL, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—To fag: as a
    breakfast waiter.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 48. However, as boys came to
  school better scholars, and were consequently higher placed, fourth
  form fags grew scarce, and the junior fifth were ordered, as the
  phrase was, TO GO ON HALL. One champion stood upon his rights, and
  refused; the indignant prefect proposed to thrash him publicly; the
  juniors rose in a body and pinioned the prefects. Fond mammas, and
  other declaimers against school tyranny, will regret to hear that this
  spirited resistance was not appreciated by Dr. Williams; after a
  patient hearing of the pleas on both sides, he supported the prefect’s
  authority (it may be concluded that they had not really exceeded it),
  and six of the ringleaders were expelled.


*Hall-crier*, _subs._ (Shrewsbury).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 249. And two HALL-CRIERS (or
  latterly one), whose chief business was to read out at breakfast time
  lists of the fags on duty for cricket or football, descriptions of
  lost articles, &c. &c. This office in former days had commonly to be
  performed under a fire of such missiles as came handiest—amongst them
  often the regulation iron spoons supplied for the bread-and-milk
  breakfast which was the fare in the rougher days of Shrewsbury. Each
  proclamation began in due form with “Oh yes! oh yes! (Oyez! oyez!)”
  and ended with “God save the King (or Queen)! and d—— the Radicals!”


*Hall-fagging*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A duty imposed on
    sixteen of the lowest boys in each House. They have to
    attend in Hall, usually four at a time, and carry out
    orders, while the monitors have breakfast and tea. There
    was no need for this duty at Old Charterhouse, fags
    being always at hand. At New Charterhouse this was not
    always the case; they were often playing at football or
    cricket, or sitting in the library. Monitors, therefore,
    arranged the system of HALL-FAGGING. Latterly it has
    become usual to send into Hall fags who have offended
    against monitorial discipline, have been talkative in
    BANCO, or noisy in the cubicles. Where such culprits are
    available the regular fags are exempt.—TOD.


*Halve*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A half-holiday: on Wednesdays
    and Saturdays.


*Halves* (pron. _Hāves_), _subs._ (Winchester:
    obsolete).—Half-Wellington boots, which were strictly _Non
    licet_ (_q.v._).


*Hand.* To HAND UP, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—To give
    information against; to betray.


*Handball*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—(1) The Stonyhurst form of
    Fives. Also (2) the ball used in playing; (3) the wall
    against which the game is played; and (4) the courts into
    which the wall and ground are divided.

  1887. _Stonyhurst Mag._, iii. 18, “Stonyhurst in the Fifties.” On
  Whit-Saturday HANDBALL came in. We had on that morning 2-1/2 hours’
  school ... and having gone up to the study-place to put away our books
  were let out by schools to run for places. In the old playground there
  stood one of the present HANDBALLS, one side of it belonging to the
  Higher Line, and one to the Lower. Of the Higher Line HANDBALLS [on
  each side of this HANDBALL—the wall—were two HANDBALLS or courts] one
  belonged to Rhetoric and one to Poetry. Of the Lower Line HANDBALLS
  one to Grammar and one to Rudiments. There were besides in both Higher
  and Lower Lines, other inferior HANDBALLS in the wall which separated
  the playground from the garden, where the rails now stand. They were
  called “The Pavilions,” and each contained three courts. Those in the
  Higher Line were common property, the Lower Line ones belonged to
  Rudiments, Figures, and Elements. Syntax had thus no HANDBALL and
  Rudiments had two. In the Higher Line possession of the HANDBALL
  always went to the first comers, those who first “touched-in” having
  it. In the Lower Line during after-dinner recreation (at least in the
  large HANDBALLS) it went by order of Compositions.


*Handing-up*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A form of Lynch law inflicted
    [up to the second quarter of the century] by monitors on a
    boy known to have been guilty of any highly disgraceful
    conduct reflecting on the character of the school—stealing,
    for example. The monitors satisfied themselves, after
    careful inquiry, of the guilt of the accused, and called him
    before an assembly of the Upper School in Butler’s Hall,
    where he received from each monitor a certain number of
    blows with a study toasting-fork. The punishment was severe,
    but merciful to the delinquent as an alternative in some
    cases to expulsion if the charge had been brought before the
    head-master.—THORNTON.

  either a person, four-and-twenty years of age, and of an infirm state
  of health, who is permitted to dine with the Fellows, and to wear a
  plain, black, full-sleeved gown; or else he is one who, having kept
  all the terms, by statute required previous to his law-act, is _hoc
  ipsa facto_ entitled to wear the same garment, and thenceforth ranks
  as bachelor, by courtesy.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_. HARRY SOPH, or HENRY SOPHISTER;
  students who have kept all the terms required for a law act, and hence
  are ranked as Bachelors of Law by courtesy. They wear a plain, black,

    permitted to wear a hat instead of the regulation
    mortar-board.] Also GOLD HATBAND.

  1628. EARLE, _Microcosmographie_, “Young Gentleman of the Universitie”
  (ed. ARBER, 1868). His companion is ordinarily some stale fellow that
  has beene notorious for an ingle to GOLD HATBANDS, whom hee admires at
  first, afterwards scornes.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam._ Hat Commoner; the son of a nobleman,
  who wears the gown of a Fellow Commoner with a HAT.

  1841. LYTTON, _Night and Morning_, Bk. I. ch. i. He had certainly
  nourished the belief that some one of the HATS or tinsel gowns, _i.e._
  young lords or fellow.

    flood-gate (BAILEY); also var. dial. = a garden-gate,
    wicket-gate, or half-door.]


*Hatch-thoke*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A Founder’s

    proctorised.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 89. At last they were caught

    chandelle_.

    Hertford BLUE (_q.v._). _See_ Appendix.

  _c._ 1800-29. _The Blue-Coat Boy_ [_More Gleanings from_ THE BLUE],

  some), is that “Hertford boys called the London boys, ‘Jackdaws,’ and
  those in London called those at Hertford ‘HEDGEHOGS’;” hedgehog boys
  and pigtailed masters!

  who during life had lain in wait for monied comrades, assailing them
  with importunate entreaties or even with open violence. Now they
  outstretched bony hands in vain for juicy “HIGHS,” which mocked and
  eluded their grasp; bottles of ginger-beer and cherries hovered above
  their skinny lips, as erst in “cherry-bob,” but never were they
  granted taste or sip of cool beverage or dainty morsel.


*Higher Line*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The three highest classes.


*High-master*, _subs._ (St. Paul’s and Manchester Grammar).—The

  again at half-past two. In the summer they also went out in the
  evening, but did not ascend Hills, but disported themselves below.
  These sorties were called “going on to HILLS,” the evening expedition
  being called “Underhills.” _Ibid._, iii. Ordinary offences of a
  trifling character, such as being late for Chapel or “SHIRKING HILLS”
  [_i.e._ evading going Hills], were punished by the infliction of an
  imposition—generally thirty lines of Virgil, English and Latin.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 24. Tuesdays and Thursdays
  were partial holidays, on which the boys went out to the HILLS twice;
  once in the morning, returning at nine to breakfast, and again in the
  afternoon, coming off at three. There they played at quoits, football,
  and something which seems to have borne a resemblance to cricket.

  before school-time a boy was always stationed to watch the arrival of

  dwindled to a calm, and work began.

    (Cumberland).

  1865. _John Bull_, Nov. 11. To be a HIVITE has long been considered a

  testimonials we may form an estimate, &c.


*Hobbs*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—A fad; a mental eccentricity.
    _See_ TACHS.

*Hockey-sticks and Fourpennies*, _subs. phr._ (Charterhouse).—A
    kind of irregular cricket played at Old Charterhouse. The
    bats were huge bludgeons called hockey-sticks, but without
    any curve at the end; the balls were like large fives-balls,
    and a little smaller than a regulation cricket-ball; the
    wickets were usually coats or jackets; gownboy jackets were
    much the best, because they were stiff and easily stood
    upright; the pitch was either on the football ground, where
    there was no grass, or on a flagged pavement in cloisters.

  in _Notes and Queries_, 6 S., xi. 328. For us Jonians are called
  abusively HOGGS.

  1795. _Gent. Mag._, lxv. 22. The JOHNIAN HOGS were originally
  remarkable on account of the squalid figures and low habits of the

  Mag._ (1795), lxv. 107.]

*Hog Tower*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A coaching room off Rhetoric

*Hoi Polloi*, _subs. phr._ (University).—The candidates for
    ordinary degrees. [From the Greek.] _Cf._ GULF.

  It’s go WITH A HOOK AT THE END.


*Horse-box*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A cubicle or recess in
    dormitory: about 5 or 6 feet high. Whence TO DO TEN
    HORSE-BOXES = to perform “Sinking-and-rising exercise” on
    the same.


*Hot*, _subs._ (Winchester).—1. A mellay at football. 2. A
    crowd. Hence to HOT UP (or DOWN) = to crowd; to mob.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_, 215. In Twenty-two
  and Twenty-two (_q.v._) when the ball went out of bounds, it was

  hear what we did in our dormy last night?

  evidently “burn a hole in one’s pocket” if they are left there long
  enough.


*Hot-tiger*, _subs._ (Oxford: obsolete).—Hot-spiced ale and
    sherry.


*Hound*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—_See_ quot.

    paper-chase, backwards and forwards in a short distance over
    Clifton Brook, a tributary of the Warwickshire Avon. [The

    the Hospital. The reverse of TOWNEY = of the town.

    College, Cambridge, leading from the grounds to one of the

  London called those at Hertford “Hedgehogs.”


*Jack-o’-Lantern*, _subs._ (Eton and Harrow: obsolete).—A
    nocturnal form of “Hare and Hounds.”

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 312. But there was an ancient
  form of it [“Hare and Hounds”] at Harrow, so especially attractive as
  being pursued at unlawful hours and under unusual difficulties, that
  it deserves special mention. It was known also in former days at Eton,
  and in both schools went by the name of JACK O’ LANTERN. About seven
  o’clock on winter evenings, when it was quite dark, the boys, by
  sufferance on the part of the authorities, were let out from their
  several boarding-houses into the fields below the school. A stout and
  active runner started in advance, carrying a lantern, by the light of
  which the rest pursued him in full cry. He showed or concealed his
  light from time to time, and a great point of the sport was to entice
  the hounds into some pool or muddy ditch (which “Jack” himself has
  carefully avoided) by showing the light exactly in a line on the other
  side.

  1885. THORNTON, _Harrow School_, p. 276. JACK-O’-LANTERN was abolished
  by Dr. George Butler, but re-appeared in Dr. Longley’s time as one of
  those forbidden pleasures so dear to youth. Always played in the
  evening, and originally by sufferance of the authorities, the game in
  question was simply a run across country after a lantern carried by a
  swift-footed boy. Oftentimes would the luckless hounds be enticed into
  some slough of despond, and the performers return in a condition of
  mud which may find its equal on a wet football day or a paper-chase
  forty years later, but yet present no adequate idea of the confusion
  caused by the return from JACK-O’-LANTERN, of thirty or forty boys at
  night when in ordinary clothes. It is one of the most distinct
  evidences that no discipline existed when we read of such a proscribed
  saturnalia having occurred after lock-up in Dr. Longley’s time. But
  the fact has been communicated to us by Harrow men whose word is
  indisputable.

    appropriate; (3) to engage: _e.g._ “He JOCKEYED me UP to
    books”; “Who has JOCKEYED my baker”; “This court is

    from turf slang. JOCKEY NOT = the Commoner cry claiming
    exemption, answering to “feign” at other schools: of which
    the College “finge” seems a translation. The opposite of
    JOCKEY UP = to LOSE DOWN.—_Notions._

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov. p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” Here
  let me observe that only the præfects have separate basins to wash in;
  the juniors use the two stone conduits. As there are seven who are not

  of not continuing so long; for, even on a whole holiday, we seldom had
  more than two hours of it.


*Kick-off*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Taking the football in hand
    and kicking it into the air: this was done after each SCHITT

  the contents of your master’s musical _mélange_.”

  afternoon Father Dick, who as soon Would KNOCK IN or “cut chapel,” as
  jump o’er the moon, Was missing at vespers—at complines—all night! And
  his monks were of course in a deuce of a fright.

  1853. CUTHBERT BEDE, _Verdant Green_, I. xi. At first, too, he was on
  such occasions greatly alarmed at finding the gates of Brazenface
  closed, obliging him thereby to KNOCK IN.

    holiday.


*Leaving-money*, _subs._ (Eton). _See_ quot.

  1865. _Etoniana_, p. 70. The restrictions [_temp._ Eliz.] by which the
  masters were forbidden to take any fees (even from oppidans) was
  probably evaded, almost from the first, by the system then universal
  in all transactions of giving presents, under which heading the sons
  of wealthy parents soon began to pay pretty highly for their
  education. Traces of this arrangement remain in the custom still
  prevailing—not at all to the credit of the school—of presenting a sum
  as LEAVING-MONEY to the head-master and the private tutor. At what
  time assistant-masters were first appointed does not appear; but they
  were no doubt paid, up to a comparatively late date, entirely from
  such fees as the parents of those under their tuition chose to give
  them.

    twice a year, at Shrove-tide and at Easter.


*Lemon Peel Fight*, _subs. phr._ (Charterhouse: obsolete).—_See_
    quot.

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, 80. On Shrove-Tuesday, according to a
  custom dating from 1850 or probably earlier, every boy used to receive
  half a lemon with his pancake at dinner. This he reserved to use as a
  missile in the fight which was to take place directly afterwards. At
  Old Charterhouse, gownboys used to stand against the rest of the
  school, and the fight consisted in each side pelting the other with
  the half lemons. It lasted for fifteen or twenty minutes, and was
  begun and ended by a house bell being rung. During these twenty
  minutes a good many bruises and black eyes could be received, for
  combatants fought at quite close quarters; and unpopular monitors were
  sometimes badly damaged. At New Charterhouse the sides were at first
  Old Charterhouse _v._ New. In 1877 they were changed again to
  Out-houses _v._ The Rest. This was the last fight. Grave abuses had
  crept in. The lemons were no longer simple lemons, but a sort of
  bomb-shell, loaded with pebbles or ink, and several boys were badly
  hurt. So the Sixth Form in 1878 “totally abolished LEMON PEEL as a
  barbarous and obsolete practice.” It required a strong Sixth Form to
  do this, for the fight was popular, and their action is one of the
  best things that the school has done for itself. Its abolition differs
  from the abolition of fighting; the latter became obsolete through the
  action of public opinion; LEMON PEEL was abolished by an ukase almost
  in defiance of public opinion.

  assembly, a LEVY of the school, had been held, at which the captain of
  the school had got up, and, after premising that several instances had
  occurred of matters having been reported to the masters; that this was

  forks, but pieces of stick called LONG FORKS.


*Long-glass*, _subs._ (Eton).—_See_ quot.

  1883. *Brinsley Richards*, _Seven Years at Eton_, 321. A glass nearly
  a yard long, shaped like the horn of a stage-coach guard, and with a
  hollow globe instead of a foot. It held a quart of beer, and the
  ceremony of drinking out of it constituted an initiation into the
  higher circle of Etonian swelldom. There was LONG-GLASS drinking once
  or twice a week during the summer half. The _invités_ attended in an
  upper room of Tap after two, and each before the long glass was handed
  to him had a napkin tied round his neck. It was considered a grand
  thing to drain the glass without removing it from the lips, and
  without spilling any of its contents. This was difficult, because when
  the contents of the tubular portion of the glass had been sucked down,
  the beer in the globe would remain for a moment as if congealed there:
  then if the drinker tilted the glass up a little, and shook it, the
  motionless beer would give a gurgle and come with a sudden rush all
  over his face. There was a way of holding the long glass at a certain
  angle by which catastrophes were avoided. Some boys could toss off
  their quart of ale in quite superior style, and I may as well remark
  that these clever fellows could do little else.

*Long Quarter*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—One of the school terms:
    now the shortest of the three, which are LONG, SUMMER, and

    _See_ Appendix.

  1864. _The Press_, Nov. 12. By the way, we miss the Etonian word
  LOUNGE, for which there is classic authority. “I don’t care for
  dinner,” said Harry Coningsby at his grandfather’s table; “breakfast
  is my LOUNGE.”


*Lout*, _subs._ (Rugby).—Any one of the poorer classes: not
    necessarily an awkward, lubberly individual.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, v. “Hullo tho’,” says East,
  pulling up, and taking another look at Tom, “this’ll never do—haven’t

  1667. PEPYS, _Diary_, iv. 482 [BICKERS, 1875]. The king is MAD at her
  entertaining Jermin, and she is MAD at Jermin’s going to marry from
  her, so they are all MAD; and so the kingdom is governed.

  1816. PICKERING, _Collection of Words, &c._, s.v. MAD, in the sense of
  “angry,” is considered as a low word in this country, and at the
  present day is never used except in very familiar conversation.

  1824. R. B. PEAKE, _Americans Abroad_, i. 1. I guess—I’m MADDED, but

  fifteen to thirty. As, a MAN of Emanuel—a young member of Emanuel.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iii. The thought that he was going to
  be an Oxford MAN fortunately assisted him in the preservation of that
  tranquil dignity and careless ease which he considered to be the
  necessary adjuncts of the manly character ... and Mr. Verdant Green
  was enabled to say “Good-bye” with a firm voice and undimmed
  spectacles.

  MATHEMAT does take the labours of his hands to the Queen, and is proud
  to do so; but it is a pity that the reputation of the school should
  depend upon such ceremonies as these. [_See_ Appendix.]

  1900. _Pall Mall Gaz._, 20th Mar., 3. 2. One of the things that strike
  a stranger is the metal plate upon some shoulders, so it may be as
  well to say here that it merely marks the members of the Mathematical
  School, which trains boys for the sea, and interested Mr. Samuel
  Pepys.

*Matron’s-gift*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1844. _Reminiscences of Christ’s Hospital_ [Blue, Aug. 1874].
  Once annually the boys were served at supper with what was called the
  “MATRON’S GIFT,”—cream cheese; but they never could appreciate this
  luxury. It was in vain that the good old matron, with a sister the
  very counterpart of herself, walked round the different tables,
  expatiating in glowing terms upon the merits of this “beautiful
  cheese,” as she called it, and wondering how any one could fail to
  have a liking for this luxurious gift.


*May*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—Easter Term examinations, &c.

  1852. BRISTED, _Five Years, &c._, 70. As the _MAY_ approached I began

  and the girls are coming up here for the MAY week. It’s called the MAY
  week, but we always have it early in June now. I believe, some years
  ago, it really used to be in May.

*Mess*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 219.
  MESS—The Præfects’ tables in Hall were called “Tub, Middle, and Junior
  MESS” respectively. The boys who dined at each were also so named. Any
  number of boys who habitually breakfasted together were so called with
  some distinguishing prefix, such as “Deputy’s MESS.” In Chambers tea
  was called MESS; as was also the remains of a joint of meat. Lest the
  reader should make a “MESS” of all these different meanings, I will
  give a sentence in which they shall all figure: “Look there, Junior
  MESS has sat down at Tub MESS, but as they will find nothing left but
  a MESS, they had better go down to Chambers, as MESS is ready.”


*Middle-briars*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A recess in the middle

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life_, p. 84. There were ... eight

  1864. _Reader_, Oct. 22. MOAB, a ... hat.... University it is all

  1865. _Etoniana_, 21. Like Wykeham’s scholars, the Eton boys rose
  [_temp._ Eliz.] at five, said their Latin prayers antiphonally while
  dressing, then made their own beds and swept out their chambers. Two
  by two they then “went down” to wash, probably at some outdoor conduit
  or fountain like the old Winchester MOAB.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 45. Independent of very early
  hours and somewhat coarse fare, it was not pleasant to have to wash at
  the old MOAB, as it was called—an open conduit in the quadrangle,
  where it was necessary, on a severe winter morning, for a junior to
  melt the ice on the stop-cock with a lighted faggot before any water
  could be got to flow at all.

    Whit-Tuesday of every third year to a mound (Lat. _ad
    montem_) near the Bath Road, and exacting a gratuity from
    persons present or passing by. The collection was given to
    the captain or senior scholar, and helped to defray his
    expenses at the University. _See_ SALT, and _Sloane MS._
    4839, f. 85.

  1890. BREWER, _Phrase and Fable_, s.v. SALT-HILL. The mound at Eton
  [near the Bath Road], where the Eton scholars used to collect money
  from the visitors on Montem day. The mound is still called _Salt
  Hill_, and the money given was called _salt_. The word salt is similar
  to the Latin _sala’rium_ (salary), the pay given to Roman soldiers and
  civil officers. _Ibid._ _Montem_.... Sometimes as much as £1000 was
  thus collected.


*Morning-hills*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. Mansfield, _School-Life_, 52. On holidays and Remedies we

  1857. CUTHBERT BEDE, _Verdant Green_, pt. II. ch. iii. “I don’t mind
  this ’ere MORTAR-BOARD, sir,” remarked the professor of the noble art
  of self-defence, as he pointed to the academical cap which surmounted
  his head.

  1864. _Fun_, 21st May, p. 96. Anon I saw a gentle youth (no “_sub
  fusc_” undergrad.). “_Toga virilis_” he had none, no MORTAR-BOARD he
  had.

  1881. PASCOE, _Every-day Life_, 147. On admission ... a boy provides
  himself with a MORTAR or college-cap.

  1898. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” The wearing
  of a cap and gown is another novelty for freshmen. At first one is apt
  to feel very foolish under a “MORTAR-BOARD” and in the folds of the
  academic gown, particularly in the miserable garb assigned to
  commoners (_i.e._ undergraduates without scholarships).


*Mouse-digger*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

    TO MUFF A CATCH, _verb. phr._ (Stonyhurst).—To catch a ball
    against the chest, or in any way not clean with both hands.
    In cricket, as played at Stonyhurst, such a catch did not
    put the batsman out: obsolete.

    work hard: _e.g._ I MUGGED all the morning, and shall
    thoke (Winchester) this afternoon. (2) To take pains; to
    beautify: _e.g._ “He has MUGGED his study, and made it
    quite cud.” [_Cf._ _mug_ = to paint the face or “make

  sections.

  NAME. An order given to a delinquent by the Head or Second Master,
  which was carried out by the boy requesting the Ostiarius to do so,
  the consequence of which was, that at the end of school that officer
  presented to the Master the victim’s name on a Roll, who forthwith
  received a Scrubbing. When the words to the Bible-clerk were added,
  the business was confided to that officer, who, with the Ostiarius,
  officiated at the subsequent ceremony, which in this case was called a
  Bibler.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, xxiii. 429. ORDER YOUR NAME, the direction
  given to an offender by any of the authorities. The boy so directed,
  if he was in College, or if the order was given in school, had to go
  to the Ostiarius—or to the Præfect in course, if the offence was
  committed in Commoners—and give information of the order, and the
  reason why it had been given. The Ostiarius, or the Præfect in course,
  wrote down the culprit’s name, together with that of the Master, and
  the offence, and carried it up to the Head or Second Master, when due
  execution was done.

  not know.

*Non-attached* (or *Non-collegiate*), _adj._ (Oxford).—Most of
    the students belong to a college or hall, but in 1868 what
    was at first known as the “NON-ATTACHED,” and is now
    designated the “NON-COLLEGIATE” system, was established. The
    system, a revival of one that prevailed in ancient times, is
    under the control of a body termed the Delegacy, the chief
    officer being named the Censor. Efficient provision is made
    for tuition, but its members live in their own lodgings in
    the city, and are thus able to suit their own pockets.
    Supervision is retained over the lodging-houses in a
    sanitary and other points of view, from the fact that they
    have to be licensed by the University authorities.


*Non-licet*, _adj._ and _adv._ (Winchester).—Illegal;

*Nurse*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—A matron.

  _c._ 1800. “Christ’s Hospital Seventy-five Years Ago” (_Blue_, Nov.,
  1875). The NURSES were permitted to flog and punish the boys as they
  thought proper, and some of the NURSES were cruel women. One poor
  fellow in my ward was labouring under a bodily infirmity. The brute of
  a nurse used constantly to flog him with nettles, fresh-gathered from
  time to time for the purpose, declaring they had the virtue of
  strengthening his bodily frame, &c.! [_See_ Appendix.]


*Nursery* (The), _subs._ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—A gallery at
    one end of Big School, in which the lowest two classes are
    taught.






*Oak*, _subs._ (University).—An outer door. TO SPORT ONE’S OAK =
    to be “not at home,” indicated by closing the outer door.

  1785. GROSE, _Vulg. Tongue_, s.v.

  provided with an OAK or outer door, with a spring lock, of which the
  master has one key, and the servant another.

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_, iv. This is the

  1861. HUGHES, _Tom Brown at Oxford_, vii. One evening he found himself
  as usual at Hardy’s door about eight o’clock. The OAK was open, but he
  got no answer when he knocked at the inner door.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 55. He tried to keep them out, but

    three dormitories—“Upper Olds,” “Under Olds,” and “Under
    Under.” _See_ NEWS.

    start given by the Præfect of Hall when the School went in
    procession to Hills, Cathedral, &c. Also as in quot. _See_
    Appendix.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life_, 222. When any person or thing of
  importance was known to be likely to meet the boys when on Hills, the
  word was passed that he, she, or it was ON—_e.g._ Ridsworth ON, snobs
  ON, badger ON, &c.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, xxiii.


*On-and-Off*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—Lemonade.

  1894. _Tonbridgian_, No. 330, 919. The scene is one of the wildest
  disorder. The writhing mass, in their efforts to obtain the desired
  article, tread on each other’s toes, spill the “OFF AND ON” down one
  another’s garments, and knock each other about with their elbows.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 444. “ON AND OFF” signifies home
  lemonade, and is so called because of the tap from which it flows.


*Ones*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A competition at football, one player
    a side: organised by Mr. Bowen. The play is for five
    minutes, the ground measures 40 yards by 30 yards, and the
    BASES (_q.v._) 8 feet.


*Oppidan*, _subs._ (Eton).—A boy who boards in the town, as
    distinguished from a King’s Scholar.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 31. The Latin-English term OPPIDAN was applied to
  these independent scholars at least as early as Fuller’s days.
  Speaking of the College, he says, “There be many OPPIDANES there
  maintained at the cost of their friends.”

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Nov., p. 367. If there is any need for a
  test match between college and the OPPIDANS, we should suggest that
  they should play the winning house in the House match, and hope to
  beat it.


*Optime*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The name given to the second
    class in the first portion of the public examination for
    honours, called the Mathematical Tripos, those placed in the
    first class being known as WRANGLERS (_q.v._), and those in
    the third class as Junior Optimes.

    the Big School door: seventeenth century.


*Ostiarius*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—_See_ quots.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_, 223. OSTIARIUS, an
  office held by the Præfects in succession. The duties were, to keep
  order in school, collect the Vulguses, and prevent the boys from
  shirking out. It is also the official title for the Second Master.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 133. A peculiarity in the arrangements at Eton is,
  that the school is practically divided into two. The division seems to
  have been in force from the very earliest times—the three lower forms
  having been then, as now, under the charge of the OSTIARIUS, or, as he
  is now called, the lower master, who has the appointment of his own
  provost-assistants, and is practically independent of the head-master,
  and subject only to the control of the provost.

  1866. _Wykehamist_, No. 1, Oct. We know of nothing more which calls
  for notice, except the revival by Dr. Moberly of the OSTIARIUS—an
  office which had been discontinued for many years, but was revived by
  the Head-master on account of the great increase in the number of the
  school.

  1878. ADAMS, _Wykehamica_, xxiii. 429. OSTIARIUS, the Præfect in
  charge of school.

    eight OUT-HOUSES are Girdlestonites, Lockites, Weekites,
    Hodgsonites, Bodeites, Daviesites, Pageites, and Robinites
    (the last a contraction of Robinsonites). Except Bodeites,
    each house bears the name of its first master. One house,
    Uskites—from a supposed similarity of the surroundings to
    the valley of the Usk—disappeared in 1878.


*Out-match*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A match played against a
    visiting team.


*Over-school*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A kind of common sitting-room
    in the “new” building of 1755. The boys’ boxes were kept
    there, and ASH-PLANTING (_q.v._) inflicted. The present

    is generally in the form of writing-pads, from which a sheet
    may be separated as wanted.]


*Pageites* (Charterhouse).—_See_ OUT-HOUSES.


*Palmer*, _subs._ (Durham: obsolete).—A sly fellow.


*Pancake.* TOSSING THE PANCAKE, _verb. phr._
    (Westminster).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 171. The old Shrove-Tuesday
  custom of TOSSING THE PANCAKE, though now peculiar to Westminster, is
  said to have been also formerly in use at Eton. The ceremony as at
  present performed is this. The cook, preceded by the verger, enters
  the large school, in full official costume, with the hot cake in the
  pan. He tosses it—or tries to toss it, for it is no easy feat—over the
  iron bar, which has been already mentioned as having once held a
  curtain screening off the upper school from the lower. If he succeeds
  he claims a fee of two guineas. There is a scramble among the boys,
  who stand on the other side of the bar, for the PANCAKE, and if any
  boy can secure it whole, which seldom happens, he carries it up to the
  dean, who presents him with a sovereign. They also claim a right to
  “book” the performer (_i.e._ hurl a shower of books at him) if he
  fails more than once. This right was liberally exercised in 1865, when
  the wrath of the school had culminated owing to repeated failures in
  that and the previous year. The exasperated cook replied to the attack
  with his only available missile—the frying-pan—and a serious row was
  the consequence. The battle is celebrated in a clever mock-heroic
  poem, in Greek Homeric verse, attributed to a high Westminster
  authority.


*Pandie*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—A stroke
    from the leather strap known as the TAWSE (_q.v._), used in
    Scotland instead of the cane; a PAUMIE (_q.v._). [From the
    order given in Latin, _Pande manum_. _See_ _Redgauntlet_.]


*Pantile*, _subs._ (general).—A flat cake covered with jam.


*Panupetaston*, _subs._ (University: obsolete).—A loose overcoat
    with wide sleeves.

    pleasant look-out.]


*Part.* _See_ BOOKS.


*Party Roll*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A list of boys going home
    together. _See_ PEALS.


*Passy*, _adj._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Severe: of a master. [That
    is, “passionate.”—BLANCH.] _See_ Appendix.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874]. Rightly
  or wrongly, it was the general opinion in our time that punishment in
  school depended less upon the correctness with which the lessons were
  said, than upon the temper of the particular master. Frequently and
  anxiously the question was asked, “Is he PASSY this morning?” and the
  arrival of a new master created immense excitement. Our first queries
  were invariably of his manners and temper—matters of far more
  importance to us than any question as to his ability.


*Patrol*, _subs._ (Dulwich).—Keeping order in Form rooms between
    morning and afternoon school: a duty of school Præfects.


*Paul’s-pigeons*, _subs._ (common).—The scholars of St. Paul’s

*Pawmie*, _subs._ (Royal High School, Edin.: obsolete).—A stroke
    on the hand from the leather strap known as the TAWSE

    (_q.v._). [_Paum_ = palm of the hand.]


*Pavvy, The* (Harrow).—The pavilion on the cricket-ground.


*Pax*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A chum; an intimate friend. [_Cf._
    Scots _pack_ = intimate, familiar.]

  1891. WRENCH, _Word-Book_, 30. Possibly the plural of “pack,” which
  word has an extended use in reference to friendship ... as _adj._,
  _subs._, and _verb_. This seems a more likely origin than the PAX of
  the Church.

    _Intj._ An injunction to desist or to silence—“Be quiet!”
    “Hands off!” Also HAVE PAX! [Almost the pure Latin use of
    the word.]


*P. D.*, _subs._ (Dulwich).—Punishment drill: in Junior School.


*Peal*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A custom in Commoners of
    singing out comments on Præfects at the beginning of
    CLOISTER-TIME (_q.v._). Also cheers given on the last three
    Sundays of the Half for articles of dress, &c., connected
    with going home, such as “Gomer Hats,” “Party Rolls,” &c....
    “The ringing of Chapel bells is also divided into PEALS.”
    [HALLIWELL.—PEALS = a noise or uproar. _Cf._ Mid. Eng.
    _apel_ = an old term in hunting music, consisting of three
    long moots.]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 62. The
  junior in chamber had a hard time of it; ... while endeavouring to get
  through his multifarious duties, he had to keep a sharp ear on the
  performance of the chapel bell, and to call out accordingly, “first
  PEAL!” “second _PEAL_!” “bells down!”

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 22. The scholars at this time
  were expected to rise at the sound of “first PEAL” at five o’clock,
  and were recommended to say privately a short Latin selection from the
  Psalms as soon as they were dressed. _Ibid._ They then swept out their
  chambers and made their beds (consisting in those days of nothing
  better than bundles of straw with a coverlet), and SECOND PEAL at
  half-past five summoned them to chapel.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” At
  6.30, I had to get back to call everybody again; and again at 6.40
  (five minutes to second PEAL); at 6.45 (“second PEAL”) when the chapel
  bell started and kept on till seven. When the bell stops I wait at the
  door and call out “præfect of chapel going in”—_i.e._ the præfect of
  the week who calls names; then “præfect of chapel in” when he reaches
  the door.

  1900. _St. James’s Gazette_, Mar. 15, “Arnoldiana.”—He [Matthew
  Arnold] was the victim of public expression of disapproval—in
  connection, Mr. Arnold thinks, with the lively ceremony known as
  CLOISTER PEALINGS, when he was placed at the end of the great school,
  and, amid howls and jeers, pelted with a rain of “pontos” for some
  time. [CLOISTER pealings is here incorrectly used: _see_ STICKING-UP.]


*Pec*, _subs._ (Eton: obsolete).—Money. [Lat. _pecunia_.]


*Pempe*, _subs._ (Winchester).—An imaginary object in search of
    which a new-comer is sent: the equivalent of “pigeon’s
    milk,” or the “squad-umbrella.” [From πεμπε μω̂ρον προτερον
    = “Send the fool farther.”]


*Penance-table*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A table in the refectory
    at which a boy is condemned to sit alone for bad behaviour
    during meals. Tradition says, with some authority, that the
    present PENANCE-TABLE is the one on which Cromwell slept
    when he spent a night at Stonyhurst. It is hence also called
    “Cromwell’s Table.”


*Penance-walk*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A path in the playground
    where malefactors are condemned to tramp in silence during
    recreation time. The form of the order given is: “Take an

  PERCHER—A mark (────┼──) put after a boy’s name on a Roll, which
  showed that he had been absent from Chapel or Hills without leave; or
  that he had not done his Verse or Prose Task, or Vulgus. It was also
  often put by a Master in the margin of gags, or a Verse or Prose Task,
  to indicate gross errors.


*Pets*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A set (says TOD) of young
    ruffians in Under Long Room whom the editor of _The Verite

*Pigeon-hole*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A small study.


*Piggin*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot.

  replenished, for we could not drink it.


*Pig-market* (The), _subs._ (Oxford).—A corridor leading to the
    Divinity School: properly the Proscholium. [Said to have
    been so used in the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII.]

  1837. INGRAM, _Memorials of Oxford_.... The schools built by Abbot
  Hokenorton being inadequate to the increasing wants of the University,
  they applied to the Abbot of Reading for stone to rebuild them; and in
  the year 1532 it appears that considerable sums of money were expended
  on them; but they went to decay in the latter part of the reign of
  Henry VIII. and during the whole reign of Edward VI. The change of
  religion having occasioned a suspension of the usual exercises and
  scholastic acts in the University, in the year 1540 only two of these
  schools were used by determiners, and within two years after none at
  all. The whole area between these schools and the divinity school was
  subsequently converted into a garden and PIG-MARKET; and the schools
  themselves, being completely abandoned by the masters and scholars,
  were used by glovers and laundresses.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iv. Our hero proceeded with his father
  along the High Street, and turned round by St. Mary’s, and so up Cat
  Street to the Schools, where they made their way to the classic
  PIG-MARKET, to wait the arrival of the Vice-Chancellor.


*Pill*, _verb_ (University).—To talk twaddle or platitudes.


*Pin*, _verb_ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—To enjoy: _e.g._ “I PINNED
    my innings”; “this is a PINNING book.”

  1887. _Stonyhurst Mag._, iii. 89. A downright enjoyable PINNABLE game.

    TO PIN A LOZEN, _verb. phr._ (Royal High School, Edin.:
    obsolete).—To break a window. [_Lozen_ = a pane of glass.]


*Pinch*. TO PINCH IN, _verb. phr._ (Harrow).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 315. Dr. Butler ... abolished,
  amongst other old customs, certain rites and ceremonies which were
  used in celebrating a boy’s remove from one form to the other in the
  lower part of the school. No such promotion was considered complete,
  so far as the boys were concerned, until the new member had been duly
  “PINCHED IN”—remaining a certain fixed time in the play-room, during
  which all the fraternity exercised a right of pinching him, limited
  only by the tenderness of their dispositions or the strength of their
  fingers. There were generally some adepts in this torture, who knew,
  and taught others, the tenderest places and the most artistic mode of
  taking hold, and who carried this evil knowledge with them from form
  to form, to be practised on a succession of victims. The rites of
  initiation were completed by tossing in a blanket in the dormitory,
  and a certain number of bumps against the ceiling were required to
  make the ceremony valid.


*Pintle*, _subs._ (Lancing).—(1) A form of cricket played with a
    bat narrowed at both sides, a soft ball, and a stone wicket
    in a pit. Also (2) = the bat used in the game. Hence
    PINTLE-SLINGER = a fast bowler.


*Pitch-up*, _subs._ (Winchester).—One’s home circle; a group; a
    crowd; a set of chums. Hence TO PITCH UP WITH = to associate
    with.


*Place*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A room: generic: as study-PLACE,
    shoe-PLACE, tailor’s PLACE, washing-PLACE, Dick’s PLACE,
    stranger’s PLACE ( = parlour).

  1891. JOHN GERARD, S.J., _Stonyhurst College_. This evidently comes
  from St. Omers, in which district, we are told, the word is still
  employed in the same promiscuous way.

    TO RUN FOR A PLACE, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” My
  next duty is what is called “running for a PLACE.” There are (or were)
  six cricket pitches on “turf,” and any præfect has a right to one of
  these all day (a bad arrangement, which I hope is altered now, as
  fellows with no idea of cricket could thus keep much better players
  off all day) provided he can get a stick with his name on, stuck in
  the ground by his fag—the half-dozen out of the fifteen or twenty fags
  running, who get their præfect’s sticks stuck in first, claiming the
  place for him. It was the same sort of thing, as if the door from the
  “underground” was opened about 6.30, and some twenty fellows rushed
  out early in the morning to try and get pitches.


*Plain-ruled*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The paper usually used for
    exercises, sixteen lines to a page.


*Planks* (The), _subs._ (Rugby).—_See_ quot.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, viii. The river Avon at Rugby
  is ... a capital river for bathing, as it has many nice small pools
  and several good reaches for swimming, all within about a mile of one
  another, and at an easy twenty minutes’ walk from the School. This
  mile of water is rented, or used to be rented, for bathing purposes by
  the Trustees of the School, for the boys. The footpath to Brownsover
  crosses the river by THE PLANKS, a curious old single-plank bridge
  running for fifty or sixty yards into the flat meadows on each side of
  the river—for in the winter there are frequent floods. Above THE
  PLANKS were the bathing-places for the smaller boys; SLEATH’S, the
  first bathing-place, where all new boys had to begin, until they had
  proved to the bathing men (three steady individuals, who were paid to
  attend daily through the summer to prevent accidents) that they could
  swim pretty decently, when they were allowed to go on to ANSTEY’S,
  about one hundred and fifty yards below. Here there was a hole about
  six feet deep and twelve feet across, over which the puffing urchins
  struggled to the opposite side, and thought no small beer of
  themselves for having been out of their depths. Below THE PLANKS came
  larger and deeper holes, the first of which was WRATISLAW’S, and the
  last SWIFT’S, a famous hole, ten or twelve feet deep in parts, and
  thirty yards across, from which there was a fine swimming reach right
  down to the Mill. SWIFT’S was reserved for the sixth and fifth forms,
  and had a spring-board and two sets of steps; the others had one set
  of steps each, and were used indifferently by all the lower boys,
  though each house addicted itself more to one hole than to another.
  The School-house at this time affected WRATISLAW’S hole, and Tom and
  East, who had learnt to swim like fishes, were to be found there as
  regular as the clock through the summer, always twice, and often three
  times a day.


*Plant*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A blow with a football. Also as
    _verb_.


*Play*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete—otherwise general).—A
    holiday, half or whole.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 115. Eton versification was very good indeed ...
  exercises ... from their excellence, were laid before the provost, by
  a time-honoured custom, as a claim for the weekly half-holiday called
  “PLAY”—a ceremony which some other public schools have borrowed.

    TO BEG A PLAY (Westminster).—_See_ EARLY PLAY and
    WESTMINSTER PLAY.


*Playing-fields*, _subs._ (Eton).—There are seven separate
    grounds—Upper Club, Lower Club, Upper Sixpenny, Sixpenny,
    Jordan, Mesopotamia, and the new ground in “Agars Plough.”

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 59. Every one knows the PLAYING-FIELDS.
  They are the crowning glory, the eye of Eton ... they are always
  beautiful.


*Pleb*, _subs._ (Westminster).—A tradesman’s son.


*Pledge*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To give away: _e.g._ “PLEDGE me”
    = “after you”; “PLEDGE you” = “give, pass, or lend me;”
    “I’ll PLEDGE it you when I’ve done with it.”

  1882. SKEAT [WRENCH]. SKEAT says it comes from a Latin _præbium_,
  connected with præbere, in which case PLEDGE simply means “give.”


*Plodge*, _verb_ (Durham).—To paddle.


*Plough* (or *Pluck*), _verb_ (common).—To reject: as in an
    examination.

  1785. GROSE, _Vulg. Tongue_, s.v. PLUCK.... Signifies to deny a degree
  to a candidate at one of the universities, on account of
  insufficiency. The three first books of Euclid, and as far as
  Quadratic Equations in Algebra, will save a man from being PLUCKED.
  These unfortunate fellows are designated by many opprobrious
  appellations, such as the Twelve Apostles, the Legion of Honour, Wise
  Men of the East, &c.

  1847. C. BRONTË, _Jane Eyre_, x. He went to college and he got
  PLUCKED, as I think they call it.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iii. Verdant read up most desperately
  for his matriculation, associating that initiatory examination with
  the most dismal visions of PLUCKING, and other college tortures.
  _Ibid._, xi. Note. When the degrees are conferred, the name of each
  person is read out before he is presented to the Vice-Chancellor. The
  proctor then walks once up and down the room, so that any person who
  objects to the degree being granted may signify the same by pulling or
  PLUCKING the proctor’s robes. This has been occasionally done by
  tradesmen, in order to obtain payment of their “little bills,” but
  such a proceeding is very rare, and the proctor’s promenade is usually
  undisturbed.

  1855. BRISTED, _Eng. Univ._, 258. If a man is PLUCKED—that is, does
  not get marks enough to pass—his chance of a Fellowship is done for.

  1863. READE, _Hard Cash_, Prol. Gooseberry pie ... adds to my chance
  of being PLOUGHED for SMALLS.

  1886. STUBBS, _Mediæval and Mod. Hist._, 386. I trust that I have
  never PLUCKED a candidate ... without giving him every opportunity of
  setting himself right.

  1895. POCOCK, _Rules of the Game_, i. I knew one of that lot at
  Corpus; in fact, we were crammed by the same tutor for “smalls,” and
  both got PLOUGHED.


*Pluck*. _See_ PLOUGH.


*Plug*, _subs._ (common).—A translation; a CRIB (_q.v._).

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_.... Getting up his
  subjects by the aid of those royal roads to knowledge, variously known
  as cribs, crams, PLUGS, abstracts, analyses, or epitomes.


*Poacher*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—At football a player stationed
    near an enemy’s goals to trouble his SECOND-GUARDERS
    (_q.v._). They are not allowed to go within the
    “Second-guarder’s” or POACHING line.


*Pœna*, _subs._ (general).—An imposition.


*Poet*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—See POETRY.


*Poetry*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The Fifth Form. [From the former
    chief study of the Form: originally THE HUMANITIES. _Cf._
    _Regulæ Professoris Humanitatis_ in the _Ratio Studiorum
    Societatis Jesu_.]


*Poet’s-walk*, _subs._ (Eton).—A river-walk in the
    playing-fields. POET’S-WALK = the tea those playing in Upper
    Club have on half-holidays by the river.


*Pog*, _subs._ (Felsted).—The face. _See_ Appendix.

  1895. _Felstedian_, April, p. 44. We won the game by one goal, three
  rouges—points to its origin. “POG” may have meant a “melancholy” face
  originally, and in time come to denote any Felstedian’s visage, grave
  or gay.

  1897. _Felstedian_, May, p. 87. I ... prayed that he wasn’t going to
  drag in “Cheese” or “POG,” or any similar atrocities.


*Pojam*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A poem: set as an exercise.


*Poker*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A BEDEL (_q.v._) carrying a silver
    mace before the Vice-Chancellor.

  1841. _Rime of the New-Made Baccalere._ Around, around, all, all
  around, On seats with velvet lined, Sat Heads of Houses in a row, And
  Deans and College Dons below, With a POKER or two behind.

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_, vii. A sort of young
  procession—the Vice-Chancellor, with his and Yeoman-bedels. The silver
  maces carried by the latter gentlemen, made them by far the most showy
  part of the procession.... _Ibid._ Tom is the bell that you hear at
  nine each night; the Vice has to see that he is in proper condition,
  and, as you have seen, goes out with his POKERS for that purpose.

  1865. _Cornhill Mag._, Feb., 225. The heads of houses and university
  officers attend [St. Mary’s, Oxford] in their robes, and form a
  stately procession to and from the church. The Vice-Chancellor is
  escorted by his mace-bearers, familiarly called POKERS, to and from
  his residence.


*Poll*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The ordinary examination for
    the B.A. degree, as distinguished from the “Honours”
    examination. Also a student who takes the “Pass” degree
    without “Honours.” Hence POLL-DEGREE and POLL-MAN. TO GO
    OUT IN THE POLL = to take an ordinary degree.

  1855. BRISTED, _Eng. Univ._, 62. Several declared that they would GO
  OUT IN THE POLL.

  1884. JAS. PAYN, in _Cornhill_, April, 370. I took my degree,
  however—a first-class POLL; which my good folks at home believed to be
  an honourable distinction.

  1889. _Academy_, Mar. 2. It is related of some Cambridge POLL-MAN that
  he was once so ill-advised as to desert a private tutor.

    _Verb_ (Christ’s Hospital).—To maltreat; to make impure.
    [That is, “pollute.”]


*Ponto*, _subs._ (general).—New bread kneaded into a ball.

  1900. _St. James’s Gazette_, Mar. 15, “Arnoldiana.” He [Matthew
  Arnold] was placed at the end of the great school, and, amid howls and
  jeers, pelted with a rain of PONTOS for some time. The PONTO, though a
  soft missile, being but the inside of a new roll, was probably
  sufficient in quantity.


*Pony*, _subs._ (general).—A translation; a CRIB (_q.v._)—any
    adventitious aid to study. Also as _verb_.

  1832. _Tour through College_, 30. Their lexicons, PONIES, and
  textbooks were strewed round their lamps on the table.

  1856. HALL, _College Words_, s.v. PONY. So called, it may be, from the
  fleetness and ease with which a skilful rider is enabled to pass over
  places which to a common plodder may present obstacles.


*Poon*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To prop up a piece of furniture
    with a wedge under the leg.—WRENCH.


*Pop*, _subs._ (Eton).—A club at Eton. Chiefly confined to
    OPPIDANS (_q.v._), though COLLEGERS (_q.v._) are sometimes
    elected.

  1865. _Etoniana_, 207. “The Eton Society,” for reading and debates,
  has had a longer and more successful existence than the magazines. It
  is better known by its sobriquet of “POP,” supposed to be a
  contraction of Popina, the rooms where it was held for many years
  having been over a cookshop or confectioner’s. It was first instituted
  in 1811, when Charles Fox Townshend (who was the elder brother of the
  late Marquess, and died young) was the first president, and it has
  gone on ever since with considerable popularity and success. The
  preparation of the speeches leads to a certain amount of historical
  reading for the purpose; but the chief attraction of “POP” lies in its
  being a sort of social club, where papers and reviews are taken in;
  and, as the numbers are strictly limited (originally twenty-two, since
  increased to twenty-eight), to be elected into the society gives a boy
  a certain degree of prestige in the school. In summer the debates are
  almost nominal, out-door attractions being too strong; but in winter
  they sometimes last for several hours, and are kept up with great
  spirit. The members are almost exclusively oppidans, this being one of
  the points where the jealousy between them and the collegers comes out
  very distinctly. A few of the latter are admitted, but only when they
  have some special claim to popularity.


*Portionist.* _See_ Postmaster.


*Poser*, _subs._ (Winchester and Eton).—An examiner: formerly a
    bishop’s examining chaplain—at Eton for King’s College, and
    at Winchester for New College Scholarships and Exhibitions.
    Also APPOSER, OPPOSER, and OPPOSITOR. [_Posen_ = to
    examine.—_Prompt. Parv._, 144.]

  1574. QUEEN ELIZABETH, _Endorsement on Recommendation of Candidates
  for College Election_, May 8. To our trustie and welbeloved the
  wardens of the new Colledges in Oxford and nere Winchester and other
  of them and to the OPPOSITORS and others having interest in the
  election of Scollers.

  1603. BACON, _Discourse_ [1887]. Let his questions not be troublesome,
  for that is fit for a POSER.

  1662. FULLER, _Worthies_, NORFOLK, ii. 462. The University [Cambridge]
  ... appointed Doctor Cranmer ... to be POSER-GENERAL of all Candidates
  in Divinity.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 61. The election-day, both for
  Winchester and New College, is on the Tuesday next after the 7th of
  July (St. Thomas Beckett), when the warden of New College, Oxford,
  with two of his fellows, called the POSERS (or at one time
  supervisors), arrive at the college, where they are received with a
  Latin oration “ad portas” by the senior scholar.


*Post*, _subs._ (University).—_See_ quot.

  1855. BRISTED, _Eng. Univ._, 74. Fifty marks will prevent one from
  being POSTED, but there are always two or three too stupid as well as
  idle to save their POST. These drones are POSTED separately, as “not
  worthy to be classed,” and privately slanged afterwards by the master
  and seniors. Should a man be POSTED twice in succession, he is
  generally recommended to try the air of some small college, or devote
  his energies to some other walk of life.

    _Verb._ 1. (University).—To reject: as in an examination; to
    PLUCK (_q.v._); TO PLOUGH (_q.v._).

    2. (Eton).—To put down for doing badly in COLLECTIONS
    (_q.v._), the penalty being either a holiday-PŒNA (_q.v._),
    or a SWISHING (_q.v._).

    3. (University).—To put up a man’s name as not having paid
    for food supplied by the College: supplies are then stopped
    until the account is settled.


*Postmaster*, _subs._ (Oxford).—An Exhibitioner of Merton
    College. Also PORTIONIST (_q.v._).

  1853. BRADLEY (“Cuthbert Bede”), _Verdant Green_, vii. Each college
  does its own postal department; and at Merton there are fourteen
  POSTMASTERS, for they get no end of letters there. “Oh, yes! I
  remember Mr. Larkyns ... telling us that the son of one of his old
  friends had been a POSTMASTER of Merton; but I fancied that he had
  said it had something to do with a scholarship.” “Ah, you see, it’s a
  long while since the governor was here, and his memory fails him,”
  remarked Mr. Charles Larkyns, very unfilially.

  1886. _Oxford Guide_ [S. J. & C.]. The POSTMASTERS anciently performed
  the duties of choristers, and their payment for this duty was six
  shillings and fourpence per annum.


*Post-mortem*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The examination after
    failure.

  1844. _Puck_, 13. And now tho’ I’ve passed the POST-MORTEM at last.


*Post-past*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—Dessert: at St.
    Omers.

  1882. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 112. The dessert called POST-PAST was
  always the best sort of apples or pears, and biscuits, or else
  walnuts.


*Post te*, _phr._ (Charterhouse).—The most useful (says TOD) of
    all the old Charterhouse expressions. For example, POST TE
    MATH. EX. = “Will you have the kindness to permit me to
    glance over your mathematical exercise?” Or one can give a
    POST TE of anything; _e.g._ to give a friend a POST TE of a
    book is to give him the right of its perusal when you have
    done with it. The word is also used in a subtle and
    sarcastic sense; _e.g._ POST TE hat or POST TE chum
    signifies disapproval of the hat or friend of which or whom
    the remark was made.


*Pot*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A canal lock. Whence POT-CAD = a
    workman at the saw-mills; POT-GATES = lock-gates; POT-HOUSER
    = a jump into the canal from the roof of a house called
    POT-HOUSE.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 226. POT—A
  canal lock; the one just under Hills was generally meant when the word
  was used.


*Pot-house* (The), _subs._ (Cambridge).—St. Peter’s College:
    formerly Peterhouse.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 85. He asked me what it was.... I
  hadn’t a notion, so I made a shot and said “POT-HOUSE.” He said, “I
  suppose you mean St. Peter’s College.”


*Potted-fug*, _subs._ (Rugby).—Potted-meat.


*Præfect.* _See_ PREFECT.


*Præpositor*, _subs._ (Sherborne: obsolete).—A School PRÆFECT
    (_q.v._): seventeenth century.


*Præpostor*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A PRÆFECT (_q.v._).

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, v. The master mounted into
  the high desk by the door, and one of the PRÆPOSTORS of the week stood
  by him on the steps, the other three marching up and down the middle
  of the school with their canes, calling out “Silence, silence!”...
  Then the PRÆPOSTOR who stands by the master calls out the names,
  beginning with the sixth form; and as he calls, each boy answers
  “here” to his name, and walks out.


*Prayer-book* (Harrow).—_See_ Upper School.


*Precipice.* _See_ FRESH-HERRING.


*Prefect*, _subs._ (general).—A superior or senior member of a
    school superintending in or out of school hours according to
    office and school: as in studies, preparation, games, &c.
    _See_ quots., PRÆPOSITOR, PRÆPOSTOR, &c.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 226.
  PRÆFECTS—The eighteen Senior boys in College, and the twelve senior in
  Commoners. The ten senior of those in College were said to be in “Full
  power,” and took the office of Bible-Clerk in rotation; they all had
  the power of fagging the Juniors, but those not in full power were
  supposed not to have the right of fagging on the School side of
  Seventh Chamber Passage; practically, however, they always did. One of
  the Senior PRÆFECTS was called PRÆFECT of Hall, and was responsible in
  a great measure for the conduct of the boys out of school. His duties
  and privileges were numerous. There was also a “PRÆFECT of Tub,” who
  was supposed to see that the dinner was properly distributed; a
  “PRÆFECT of School,” who had the care of that building; and two
  “PRÆFECTS of Chapel,” who during alternate weeks called names in
  Chapel. There were fees attached to all these offices; and all the
  PRÆFECTS had a certain number of boys allotted to them as Pupils, each
  of whom paid one guinea each half.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75. Here let me observe that only the
  PRÆFECTS have separate basins to wash in; the juniors use the two
  stone conduits.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. PRÆFECTS.... The number of
  Præfects was eighteen in College, three to each Chamber ... in
  Commoners first eight, with four senior-inferiors, who were like
  Præfects in half-power, and later twelve.... The word PRÆPOSTOR was
  also used concurrently, it would appear, till the last century, when
  it disappeared, except in the formula demanding a remedy, in which it
  survives. What the relations of the two words were to each other it is
  not easy to determine.... Præpostor occurs in the College Register,
  and is still used in asking for Remedies. Both seem, therefore, to be
  official words. At Eton Præpostor survives, though they are stated to
  have begun with officers bearing other titles. They have also retained
  _major_, _minor_, _minimus_, which we have discarded for _senior_,
  _secundus_, _junior_. The “Præfect of Tub”—“qui nomen ducit ab
  olla”—who presided over meals, and whose perquisites are said to have
  been most lucrative—amounting to the value of £80 per annum—and the
  “PRÆFECT of Cloisters” are obsolete offices.

  1900. _MS. Notes_ (Rev. A. GOODIER, Stonyhurst). PRÆFECTS ... These
  are four in number.


*Prep*, _subs._ 1. (Dulwich).—Evening preparation. _Cf._ BANCO,
    TOY-TIME, &c.

    2. (Felsted).—A place of preparation.

  1890. _Felstedian_, Feb., p. 2. Johnson _ma_ happened to be in PREP in
  good time, so he managed to get in a moment’s conversation with Jones.


*Preparatory*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The preparatory Form at
    Hodder: originally ABECEDARII.


*Pricking Æger.* _See_ ÆGER.


*Private-business*, _subs._ (Eton).—Extra work with the tutor.


*Privee*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A private conversation. _See_
    BOULE.


*Privs*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Special privileges in the House:
    granted to either Sixth Form or THREE-YEARERS (_q.v._).
    These take different forms in different houses. TO FIND
    (_q.v._) and to TOLLY-UP are PRIVS: so is the right to wear
    a coat that is not regulation school dress after LOCK-UP
    (_q.v._).


*Pro*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A proproctor, or second in command in
    the proctorial police. The two proctors appoint a certain

  1870. _The Blue_, Mar. It is, we believe, certain that T.R.H. the

  with their distinguished presence.

  1900. _Daily Telegraph_, Mar. 16, “London Day by Day.” That quaint and
  historic old custom known as the “public supping” of the children was
  celebrated last evening at Christ’s Hospital, Newgate Street, in the
  presence of the Lord Mayor, Alderman Vaughan Morgan (treasurer of the
  school), and other civic and educational dignitaries.

  1900. _Pall Mall Gazette_, 20th Mar., 3. 2, “A Lenten Supper.”
  Attention is directed to this festival this year for two reasons—one,
  that it is a very ancient custom; the other, that this is nearly the
  last year in which it will be held; for it is clear that when the
  school has changed its site, its dress, and certain of its officers
  and masters, it will not care to carry on this quaint old ceremony.
  And indeed, were the Hospital to hold such revelry at Horsham there
  would be few to come as guests, if the name of guest can be assigned
  to one who plays a part so passive as that of seeing other people
  eat.... The scene of the supping is the Great Hall.... Six hundred
  boys and more appear as nothing; they are all seated.... At each table
  sits a matron, according to their wards (of which there are fifteen),
  and attached to each ward is a matron, who used to be called nurse.
  Beside the tables are the monitors, responsible for order—biggish
  boys—not “Grecians,” for Grecians do not appear at the Lent suppers,
  except to read or pray or sing, having already eaten in their wards.
  The first performance, probably, is to light the candles on the
  tables; each ward has four candles, and all are lighted at almost the
  same moment. The hall is lighted from the roof by gas, so the
  candlesticks are little more than ornaments. They are of oak, old, and
  well-weighted at the base, and can count their age by centuries....
  Their quaintness is concealed by artificial flowers, which the boys
  pay for and the matrons arrange, the result more suggestive of
  suburban bonnets than antiquity and quaintness. Ask a boy Why? he will
  probably reply that “it always has been done.” Change has come; it
  used to be held on Sundays during Lent instead of Thursday as to-day,
  and up to absolutely recent years there were six suppers instead of
  four. These festivals interfere somewhat with school work, and those
  who are officially compelled to attend find sameness, even in a public
  supper, in the course of thirty years or so. As the clock strikes
  seven there is a rap, the boys stand up, the organ bursts into “God
  save the Queen,” and up the hall marches the Lord Mayor, preceded by
  the chief beadle of the Hospital, clad in gorgeous raiment and a mace
  suggestive of a fish-slice. Behind comes the treasurer of the
  Hospital, another alderman, and various governors, each bearing a
  green stick to mark his office. These sit in reserved seats at the far
  end of the hall, the Lord Mayor in _the_ chair, while on his right
  hand by the wall are masters and on his left some “officers.” The
  ceremony—a strange mixture of a religious service, a meal, and a
  feudal relic—begun with the reading of a passage from the Sermon on
  the Mount by a Grecian standing in a pulpit, whence he proceeded to
  read special prayers written for the school by Bishop Compton, ending
  with the Lord’s Prayer, after which a hymn and “grace” and then the
  supper, during which the Lord Mayor, with a select few, made the grand
  tour of the hall. Such a supper was soon over, and it was not long
  before the boys had gathered up the plates and bowls and cloths and
  knives, and then came grace and an anthem well sung by a well-trained
  choir. This was followed by the feudal feature in the evening: the
  whole school, with the exception of the Grecians, “bows round,” i.e.
  the boys walk up two and two, marshalled by two beadles, who stand
  near, and drawing near the chair, then bow the head in reverence to an
  Authority. Most boys have a “trade,” and in this procession each one
  carries a symbol of that “trade.” The matron’s special boy carries a
  bonnet-candle in each hand, the knife-boy carries his knife-basket,
  and the cloth-boy takes his cloth neatly rolled beneath his wing,
  while, last of all, the bread-boy hoists the tall bread-basket
  shoulder-high and “bows round” with it, never failing to raise a laugh
  as well as a basket. When all have bowed, the boy-marshalling beadles
  bow also, and the revels are ended. It is believed that the original
  purpose of these suppers was to rouse interest in the outside public
  and possibly raise money from their pockets; at all events, collection
  boxes used to be placed about the hall on those occasions.

*Pulling-out*, _subs._ (Charterhouse: obsolete).—PULLING-OUT
    took place on Good Fridays. A line was marked from a corner
    of green to cloisters. On one side of this line stood the
    first and second forms, _i.e._ the Uppers, on the other side
    of it the Unders. The Unders had the right of calling on any
    unpopular Upper to run the gauntlet between two rows of
    Unders from cloister doors to a point near the chapel. They
    armed themselves with implements of all kinds, such as
    sticks, or stones fastened into stockings, with which to
    inflict punishment upon the Uppers. The latter naturally
    resisted; hence there were fierce fights and dangerous
    rushes. During the PULLING-OUT of 1824, a little fellow
    called Howard, a younger son of the Earl of Suffolk, was
    entangled in one of these rushes, dragged along the ground
    for some distance, with a mass of boys upon him, and
    received injuries from which he died soon after. This was
    the end of PULLING-OUT, but the custom was as old as the
    school.—MOZLEY. Also CALLING-OUT.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 49. In the
  short half we had at least one “REMEDY,” and a half day every week,
  and in summer two always; they were on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These
  “REMEDIES” were a kind of mitigated whole holidays. We were supposed
  to go into school for an hour or two in the morning and afternoon; but
  as no Master was present, it didn’t come to much. This was called
  “Books Chambers.” REMEDIES were not a matter of right, but were always
  specially applied for by Præfect of Hall on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
  The custom was for him to waylay the Doctor on his way to morning
  chapel, and make the request, when, if granted, a gold ring was handed
  to the applicant, on which was engraved, “_commendant rarior usus_.”
  This ring was worn by the Præfect of Hall for the rest of the day, and
  returned by him to the Doctor at the beginning of middle school on the
  day following.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. REMEDY. A holiday in the
  half, with Books-chambers or Toy-time. Originally there was always
  one, and generally two REMEDIES in the week. Later every Tuesday in
  Easter-time and Cloister-time was a REMEDY, the Thursday’s REMEDY
  being often granted. Now Thursdays in Cloister-time only are REMEDIES
  proper in middle-school hours; there are on these days Morning-lines,
  and the afternoon is a half-holiday. Ascension-Day and the Queen’s
  Accession are _holidays_: all red-letter Saints’-days are
  Leave-out-days. _Remedium_ seems to have been the original word for
  holiday: translated REMEDY.... The tradition of REMEDIES being granted
  by _great persons_ survives in the custom of the Judges on Circuit
  demanding a Half-REMEDY.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, 316. Another ancient barbarism
  survived even long after Butler’s accession. There were in the
  head-master’s house two public rooms for the use of his boarders—the
  hall and the play-room. The latter was open to all, but the hall was
  regarded as a sort of club-room, which no boy was allowed to enter,
  except at dinner and supper time, until he had become a member by
  being ROLLED-IN. Any one who desired the privilege of admission (and
  none below the upper fifth were eligible), gave in his name to the
  head-boy some days beforehand, in order that due preparations might be
  made for the inauguration. Immediately a certain number of rolls
  (_finds_ they were called—etymology unknown) were ordered at the
  baker’s, and rebaked every morning until they were pretty nearly as
  hard as pebbles. At nine o’clock on the morning fixed for the
  ROLLING-IN, the members of the hall ranged themselves on the long
  table which ran along one side of the room, each with his pile of
  these rolls before him, and a fag to pick them up. The candidate
  knelt, facing them, on a form close against the opposite wall, with
  his head resting on his hands, so as to guard the face, while they
  held, as well as they could, a plate on the top of the head by way of
  helmet. Thus protected, the head itself formed a mark for the very
  peculiar missiles which were ready to be aimed. When all was ready, a
  time-keeper, watch in hand, gave the word—“Now!” when fast and
  furiously—and very spitefully, if the boy was unpopular—the rolls were
  showered upon the devoted head for the space of one minute, neither
  more nor less. Such protection as the plate gave was soon lost by its
  being broken to pieces. It was, as may be imagined, a very severe
  ordeal, the bruises being very painful for weeks afterwards.

    _Verb_ (Felsted).—To “rag”; to “scrag.” See _subs._

  1895. _Felstedian_, April, pp. 43-4. “Vic” ... entirely baffles me,

  the early numbers of the _Felstedian_—“we won the game by one goal,
  three ROUGES”—points to its origin.


*Round-Othello*, _subs._ (The Leys). A Leysian tuck-shop
    delicacy.

  milliner, and at last with my bedmaker, upon which I was sent away,
  or, in the university phrase, RUSTICATED for ever.

  1779. JOHNSON, _Life of Milton_, par. 12. It seems plain from his own
  verses to _Diodati_, that he had incurred RUSTICATION; a temporary
  dismission into the country, with perhaps the loss of a term.

  1794. _Gent. Mag._, p. 1085. And was very near RUSTICATION [at
  Cambridge], merely for kicking up a row after a beakering party.

  1841. LEVER, _Charles O’Malley_, lxxix. You have totally forgotten me,
  and the Dean informs me that you have never condescended a single line
  to him, which latter enquiry on my part nearly cost me a
  RUSTICATION.... Dear Cecil Cavendish, our gifted friend, slight of
  limb and soft of voice, has been RUSTICATED for immersing four
  bricklayers in that green receptacle of stagnant water and duckweed,
  yclept the “Haha.”

  1841. H. KINGSLEY, _Ravenshoe_, ch. viii. Non-university men sneer at
  RUSTICATION; they can’t see any particular punishment in having to
  absent yourself from your studies for a term or two.

  tells me, has just been RUSTICATED for insulting Dr. Doublechin.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iv. “The Master ... said as how Mr.
  Bouncer had better go down into the country for a year, for change of
  hair, and to visit his friends.” “Very kind indeed of Dr. Portman,”
  said our hero, who missed the moral of the story, and took the
  RUSTICATION for a kind forgiveness of injuries.

  1885. _Daily Telegraph_, Oct. 29. Students who are liable at any
  moment to be RUSTICATED.






*Saccer*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The Sacrament. _Cf._ SOCCER, RUGGER,
    BREKKER, COLLECKER, &c.


*Salt*, _subs._ (Eton).—The gratuity exacted at the now obsolete
    triennial festival of the MONTEM (_q.v._).

  1886. BREWER, _Phrase and Fable_, s.v. SALT-HILL. At the Eton _Montem_
  the captain of the school used to collect money from the visitors on
  Montem day. Standing on a mound at Slough, he waved a flag, and
  persons appointed for the purpose collected the donations. The mound
  is still called SALT-HILL, and the money given was called SALT. The
  word salt is similar to the Latin _sala’rium_ (salary), the pay given
  to Roman soldiers and civil officers.

  1890. SPEAKER, 22nd Feb., 210. 2. In lively but worldly fashion we go
  to Eton, with its buried Montem, its “SALT! your majesty, SALT!” its

  poems out of school hours, I was laughed at, and called a SAP.

  1850. SMEDLEY, _Frank Fairlegh_, 117. After several fruitless attempts
  to shake my determination, they pronounced me an incorrigible SAP, and
  leaving me to my own devices, proceeded to try their powers upon
  Oaklands.

  1856. WHYTE-MELVILLE, _Kate Coventry_, ch. xvii. At school, if he
  makes an effort at distinction in school-hours, he is stigmatised by
  his comrades as a SAP.

  1888. GOSCHEN, _Speech at Aberdeen_, Jan. 31. Remember the many
  epithets applied to those who, not content with doing their work,
  commit the heinous offence of being absorbed in it ... schools and
  colleges ... have invented for this purpose, with that peculiar
  felicity which attaches to schoolboy nomenclature, phrases,
  semi-classical, or wholly vernacular, such as a “SAP,” a “smug,” a
  “swot,” a “bloke,” a “mugster.”

    _Verb._ To read or study hard; to sweat.

  1853. LYTTON, _My Novel_, Bk. I. ch. xii. He understands that he was
  sent to school to learn his lessons, and he learns them. You call that

  May. “Carry it away, Ethel; I will have no Latin or Greek touched
  these holidays.” “You know,” said Norman, “if I don’t SAP, I shall
  have no chance of keeping up!”

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 46. I ... haven’t to go SAPPING
  round to get it when I want my own tea.

    _See_ GOWNER.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SCHITT.... This was the
  word in general use till 1860, when it was superseded by “goal.” In
  early Winchester football there seems to have been three methods of
  scoring—a _goal_, a _gowner_, a SCHITT, worth respectively 3, 2, and
  1. The last behind stood between two gowns, which made a goal. The
  ball passing over his head or between his legs scored three, over the
  gowns two, over the rest of “worms” one. When the whole of “worms” was
  made to count equally, every goal was a SCHITT.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SCOB.... An oak box with a
  double lid, set at the angles of the squares of wooden benches in
  school. It is used as desk and book-case.... Probably the word has
  been transferred from the bench itself, and comes from Fr. _Escabeau_.
  Lat. _Scabellum_.


*Sconce*, _verb_. 1. (University: once common).—To fine; to
    deduct by way of fine; to discontinue. Also as _subs._
    Whence TO BUILD A SCONCE = to run up a score (as at an
    alehouse, or of fines).

  1632. SHIRLEY, _Witty Fair One_, iv. sc. 2. College! I have had a head
  in most of the butteries of Cambridge, and it has been SCONCED to
  purpose.

  _c._ 1640. [SHIRLEY] _Captain Underwit_ [BULLEN, _Old Plays_, ii.
  323]. _Tho._ I can teach you to build a SCONCE, sir.

  1696. B. E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, s.v. SCONCE. To build a large SCONCE,
  to run deep upon tick or trust.

  1730. JAS. MILLER, _Humours of Oxford_, i. p. 9 (2nd ed.). No, no, my
  dear, I understand more manners than to leave my friends to go to
  church—no, tho’ they SCONCE me a fortnight’s commons, I’ll not do it.

  1748. T. DYCHE, _Dictionary_ (5th ed.). SCONCE (v.) ... also a cant
  word for running up a score at an alehouse or tavern.

  1760. JOHNSTON, _Chrysal_, ch. xxviii. [COOKE’S ed., N.D.]. These
  youths have been playing a small game, cribbing from the till, and
  building SCONCES, and such like tricks that there was no taking hold
  of.

  1765. GOLDSMITH, _Essays_, viii. He ran into debt with everybody that
  would trust him, and none could build a SCONCE better than he.

  1768. FOOTE, _Devil upon Two Sticks_, ii. 1. She paid my bill the next
  day without SCONCING off sixpence.

  1821. _The Etonian_, ii. 391. Was SCONCED in a quart of ale for
  quoting Latin, a passage from Juvenal; murmured, and the fine was
  doubled.

  1823. BEE, SLANG DICT., s.v. SCONCE ... To discontinue: as SCONCE his
  diet = give less victuals. SCONCE the reckoning = to go no further in
  debt, but bolt.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. SCONCE.... “To SCONCE, to eat
  more than another, _Winton_; to SCONCE, to impose a pecuniary mulct,
  _Oxon._,” Kennett, MS. To SCONCE at Oxford, was to put a person’s name
  in the College buttery books by way of fine.

  1864. HOTTEN, _Slang Dict._, s.v. SCONCE. The Dons fined or SCONCED
  for small offences; _e.g._ five shillings for wearing a coloured coat
  in hall at dinner-time. Among undergrads, a pun, or an oath, or an
  indecent remark, was SCONCED by the head of the table. If the offender
  could, however, floor the tankard of beer which he was SCONCED, he
  could retort on his SCONCER to the extent of twice the amount he was
  SCONCED in.

  1883. H. T. ELLACOMBE [_Notes and Queries_, 6 S., viii. 326]. Men were
  SCONCED if accidentally they appeared in hall undressed. I think the
  SCONCE was a quantity of beer to the scouts. The SCONCE-table was hung
  up in the buttery.

  1899. _Answers_, 14th Jan., i. 1. The average freshman is not very
  long at Oxford before he is acquainted with the mysteries of SCONCING.
  A SCONCE is a fine of a quart of ale, in which the unlucky fresher is
  mulcted for various offences in Hall.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 476. Opponents who get in each
  other’s way and “SCONCE” the “kicks.”

    2. (Winchester).—To hinder; to get in the way: as of a kick

    SCONCED, I should have made a flyer!”


*Scourge*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—To flog. Whence
    SCOURGING = a flogging of three strokes. _See_ SCRUBBING and
    TUND.

  1883. TROLLOPE, _What I Remember_.... The words “flog” or “flogging,”
  it is to be observed, were never heard among us, in the mouth either
  of the masters or the boys. We were SCOURGED.


*Scout*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A College servant: combining the
    duties of valet, waiter, messenger, &c.

  1750. _The Student_, i. 55. My SCOUT indeed is a very learned fellow.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, iii. Infatuated Mr. Green! If you
  could have foreseen that those spoons and forks would have soon
  passed—by a mysterious system of loss which undergraduate powers can
  never fathom—into the property of Mr. Robert Filcher, the excellent,
  though occasionally erratic, SCOUT of your beloved son ... you would
  have been content to have let your son and heir represent the
  ancestral wealth by any sham that would equally well have served his
  purpose!

  1884. JULIAN STURGIS in _Longmans’ Mag._, v. 65. The old don went back
  to his chair, and ... thrust the bits into the waste-paper basket, as
  his “SCOUT” came in with a note.


*Scrape out*, _verb_ (Winchester).—When a Præfect wished to go
    out of School, he SCRAPED with his foot till he got a nod
    from the Master.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Scrub*, _verb_ (Christ’s Hospital).—To write fast: _e.g._
    “SCRUB it down.” Also as _subs._ = handwriting. [Lat.
    _scribere_.] _See_ STRIVE.


*Scrubbing*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A flogging: four
    strokes at SCRUBBING-FORMS. _See_ SCOURGE.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 109. The
  ordinary punishment consisted of four cuts, and was called “A
  SCRUBBING.” The individual who was to be punished was told “to order
  his name,” which he did by going to the Ostiarius, and requesting him
  to do so; that officer accordingly, at the end of school time, would
  take his name to the Master, who would then call it out, and the
  victim had to kneel down at Senior row, while two Juniors laid bare
  the regulation space of his back. The first time a boy’s name was
  ordered, the punishment was remitted on his pleading “_Primum
  tempus_.” For a more serious breach of duty, a flogging of six cuts (a
  “Bibler”) was administered, in which case the culprit had to “order
  his name to the Bible-Clerk,” and that individual, with the help of
  Ostiarius, performed the office of Jack Ketch. If a boy was detected
  in a lie, or any very disgraceful proceeding—a rare occurrence, I am
  happy to say—he had to stand up in the centre of Junior row during the
  whole of the school time, immediately preceding the infliction of the
  flogging; this pillory process was called a “Bibler under the nail.” I
  have also heard, that for a very heinous offence, a boy might be
  punished in Sixth Chamber, in which case the number of stripes was not
  limited; but I never knew an instance of this.

  1864. _Blackwood’s Magazine_, vol. xcv., p. 79. Underneath is the
  place of execution, where delinquents are BIBLED. _Ibid._, p. 72. It
  need hardly be said that it [the rod] is applied in the ordinary
  fashion: six cuts forming what is technically called a BIBLING—on
  which occasions the Bible-Clerk introduces the victim; four being the
  sum of a less terrible operation called a SCRUBBING.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SCRUBBING.... According to
  T. A. Trollope, the word in use in his day was SCOURGING: this,
  however, he describes as of three strokes: he does not mention
  “bibling.” He was in College 1820-28.


*Scrutiny*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 62. The Oxford visitors, on
  their arrival, proceed at once to “Election Chamber” to hear any
  complaints which the boys may have to prefer. This is called the
  SCRUTINY, the seven senior prefects, and the seven juniors in chambers
  (one from each chamber), are separately questioned; but complaints are
  seldom made. Next morning the examination for election of scholars to
  New College begins—no longer in the renowned “Election Chamber”
  itself, but in the long “Warden Gallery,” as more convenient for the
  purpose; all prefects who are of standing to leave the school are
  examined with any other who choose.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SCRUTINY. An examination of
  the seven Seniors and seven Juniors in College, on the subject of
  their personal comfort, &c., in College. There were two SCRUTINEES in
  the year; one conducted by the Warden of New College and Posers in
  Election Week, the other by the Wardens and Fellows of Winchester in
  Sealing Week.


*Scud*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A runner.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, v. “I say,” said East, as he
  got his wind, looking with much increased respect at Tom, “you ain’t a
  bad SCUD, not by no means. Well, I’m as warm as a toast now.”


*Scull*, _subs._ (University).—The head (or master) of a
    College.

  1864. HOTTEN, _Slang Dict._, s.v. SCULL. The head, or master of a
  college: nearly obsolete; the gallery, however, in St. Mary’s (the
  Oxford University church), where the “Heads of Houses” sit in solemn
  state, is still nicknamed the “Golgotha” by the undergraduates.


*Scull-race*, _subs._ (University).—A University Examination.


*Scuttle*, _verb_ (Christ’s Hospital, Hertford).—To cry out

    game. Also SECONDERS.

*Semi-bejan*, _subs._ (Aberdeen).—A student in the second class.


*Semper*, _adj._ (Winchester).—Always: _e.g._ I have got SEMPER
    leave-out. _See_ Appendix.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 233. A very
  common prefix; _e.g._ a boy was said to be SEMPER Continent, Tardy, or
  Ex Trumps if he was often at Sick-house, or late for Chapel, or
  habitually went up to Books without having looked at his lessons. An
  official who was always present at the College meetings went by the
  name of SEMPER TESTIS.


*Send.* TO SEND DOWN, _verb. phr._ (University).—To expel; to
    rusticate. _See_ GO DOWN.

    up to the head-master as “very good.”


*Senior.* _See_ JUNIOR.


*Senior Hall* (Shrewsbury).—_See_ quot.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 246. The boarders reside
  chiefly either in the head-master’s house, or SENIOR HALL, as it is
  called, or in a house adjoining rented by him, and called the “Junior
  Hall.” The second-master also has a “Hall,” which will accommodate
  about twenty. But the buildings are old, in many cases badly adapted
  for their present use, and have either been purchased, built, or
  rented from time to time by the head-master as the numbers of the
  school required.


*Senior Part*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ BOOKS.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 233. SENIOR
  PART, THE FIFTH—The part next below the Præfects, generally called
  SENIOR PART.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 23. The schoolroom was still
  SEVENTH-CHAMBER—_Magna illa domus_, as the founder’s directions call
  it—though, as some of the commoners must have been taught together
  with the scholars, it is difficult to understand how so many could
  have found room there without great confusion.

    give a share.

  in the relation of an apprentice. The new boy is called the “SHADOW,”
  the other, the “Substance.” For the first week the SHADOW follows the
  Substance everywhere, takes his place next to him in class,
  accompanies him as he rises or falls, and is exempt from any
  responsibility for his own mistakes in or out of school. During this
  interval of indulgence, his patron is expected to initiate him in all
  the work of the school, to see that he is provided with the necessary
  books and other appliances, and, in short, to teach him by degrees to
  enter upon a substantial and responsible existence of his own.


*She*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A plum-pudding. _Cf._ HE.


*Sheep*, _subs._ (Aberdeen).—A second classman or undergraduate.

    dimensions, containing a number of private rooms; erected
    for temporary use, but since found of too much service to be
    demolished.

  1884. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 277. Gothic architecture of all
  descriptions, including Elizabethan, was trampled out by the
  Renaissance (revived Greek), of which SHIRK is a very bad specimen
  (where it tries to be ornamental, as in its triangular pediment and
  the pilasters beside the larger window).

    bounds. Obsolete.

    continued. The coins are furnished to the school by the
    Queen’s almoner in their unmilled state, prior to their
    issue as currency. Some are given by the head-master every
    week, and are valued quite as much as more substantial
    prizes. Silver money is also furnished by the college
    steward to the guests at the Elections dinners, that they
    may be prepared to reward the epigrams; but this is the
    ordinary coin of the realm.


*Sim*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A Simeonite, or member of the
    Evangelical section of the Church of England. The modern

    was left at the Upper or Fellows’ table, free, or nearly so.
    They were equivalent to the BATTLERS (_q.v._) or SERVITORS
    (_q.v._) of Oxford.

  1574. [R. W. CHURCH, _Spenser_ (1888), ch. i. p. 9.] On the 20th of
  May, he was admitted SIZAR, or serving clerk at Pembroke Hall.

  1670. J. EACHARD, _Contempt of the Clergy_ [ARBER’S _Garner_, vol.
  vii. p. 257]. They took therefore, heretofore, a very good method to
  prevent SIZARS overheating their brains. Bed-making, chamber-sweeping,
  and water-fetching were doubtless great preservatives against too much
  vain philosophy.

  1779. JOHNSON, _Life of Milton_, Par. 7. He was ... removed in the
  beginning of his sixteenth year to Christ’s College in Cambridge,
  where he entered a SIZAR, Feb. 12, 1624.

  1820. LAMB, _Elia_ (_Oxford in the Long Vacation_). In moods of
  humility I can be a SIZAR, or a Servitor. When the peacock vein rises,
  I strut a Gentleman Commoner.

  1840. LYTTON, _Money_, ii. 3. I was put to school—sent to college, a
  SIZAR. Do you know what a SIZAR is? In pride he is a gentleman—in
  knowledge he is a scholar—and he crawls about, amidst gentlemen and
  scholars, with the livery of a pauper on his back!

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. SIZER.... A student at
  Cambridge whose expenses for living are partially provided by the
  College, originally a servitor, as serving one of the Fellows. Each
  Fellow of a College had one servitor allotted to him.

  1754. MARTIN, _Eng. Dict._, s.v. SKIP.... A nickname for a footman.

  1839. LEVER, _Harry Lorrequer_, ch. xiii. For the uninitiated I have
  only to add that SKIP is the Trinity College [Dublin] appellation for
  servant.

  1842. _Tait’s Mag._, Oct., “Rem. College Life.” The SKIP, or according
  to the Oxford etymology, the man-vulture, is not fit for his calling
  who cannot time his business so as to be present simultaneously at
  several places.

  1849. THACKERAY, _Pendennis_, ch. xx. His wounded tutor, his many

  1881. PASCOE, _Everyday Life in our Public Schools_.... The
  consumption of SOCK, too, in school was considerable, and on occasion
  very conspicuous.

  1883. BRINSLEY-RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_.... We Eton fellows,
  great and small, SOCKED prodigiously. By the way, I do not know whence
  that term SOCK, as applied to what boys at some schools call “grub,”
  and others “tick,” is derived; for I question the theory which makes
  it spring from “suck.” I am rather disposed to accept the story that
  at the beginning of this century, one of the men, who sold fruits and
  tarts at the wall, got nicknamed SOCKS, in consequence of his having
  discarded knee-breeches and stockings in favour of pants and short
  hose. The man’s nickname might then have spread to his business and to
  his wares by a process familiar to etymologists, till SOCKING came to
  mean the purchase of good things not from SOCKS only, but from any
  other vendor.

  1889. BUCKLAND, _Eton Fifty Years Ago_ [_Macmillan’s Mag._, Nov.]. “My
  governor has SOCKED me a book.”... A boy has also been heard to ask

  ought to be very strong.


*Sodality*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—Higher Line SODALITY and Lower
    Line SODALITY = two confraternities of which boys are

  1870. GOODRICH [WEBSTER, _Unabridged_, s.v. SOPHOMOSE]. This word has
  generally been considered an American barbarism, but it was probably
  introduced into our country at a very early period from the University
  of Cambridge, England. Among the cant terms at that University, as
  given in the “_Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_,” we find SOPH-MOR as the next
  distinctive appellation to Freshman. It is added that a writer in the
  _Gentleman’s Magazine_ thinks Mor an abbreviation of the Greek μωρία,
  introduced at a time when the “Encomium Moriæ,” the “Praise of Folly,”
  by Erasmus, was so generally used. The ordinary derivation of the
  word, from σοφός and μωρός would seem, therefore, to be incorrect. The
  young SOPHS at Cambridge appear formerly to have received the adjunct
  mor, μωρός, to their names, either as one they courted for the reason
  mentioned above, or as one given them in sport for the supposed
  exhibition of inflated feeling in entering upon their new honours. The
  term thus implied seems to have passed at a very early period from
  Cambridge in England to Cambridge in America, as the next distinctive
  appellation to Freshmen, and thus to have been attached to the second
  of the four classes in our American colleges, while it has now almost
  ceased to be known, even as a cant word, at the parent institution in
  England from whence it came.


*Sorry*, _intj._ (Winchester).—“I beg your pardon.” [Not now
    confined to Winchester.—WRENCH.]

    a boy set down for Saturday afternoon detention: a DETÉN
    (_q.v._).

    _verb._ Formerly merely “to walk.” [_Cf._ Lat. _spatiari_;
    Ger. _spatzieren_.]

    _e.g._ “to look SPANGE,” “a SPANGE uniform.”


*Sparrow’s-hall*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The old
    infirmary. [The head-bailiff was one Sparrow, and here the
    servants received their wages from him.]


*Spec*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Something enjoyable or pleasant; a
    good thing. ON SPEC = in consequence.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SPEC.... What a SPEC! My
  pitch-up have turned up, and I’ve got leave-out ON SPEC.


*Speecher*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The speech-day: usually the first
    Thursday in July, when prizes are given. Greek, German, or
    French plays are acted, and there is also an afternoon
    concert. THE SPEECHER = the Speech-room, built in 1871.


*Speedyman*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—The messenger who
    brought the news of a vacancy at New College, Oxford. Whence
    SPED TO NEW COLLEGE = elected to a scholarship.


*Speg*, _adj._ (Winchester: obsolete).—Smart.


*Spending-house*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A pastry-cook’s: the custom,
    until Dr. Arnold abolished it, had been for the boys to take
    their morning and evening buttery commons of bread and cold
    milk to one of these establishments, and with “extras,” such
    as tea, coffee, butter, &c., to obtain a more decent meal
    than was otherwise possible.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, p. 150. Every boy had a SPENDING-HOUSE,
  as it was called, at one of the confectioners’ in High Street, where
  he left his books, bat, fishing-rod, &c.—to save a journey to his
  boarding-house—and spent his spare cash. It was in the back-yards of
  these houses that dogs and guns were kept.


*Spess*, _subs._ (Felsted).—A specimen: a term of contempt.

  1889. _Felstedian_, July, 66. Others ... calling out ... frightful
  SPESSES, which word is in our language “specimens”; but as this is too
  long for their memories, they have shortened it.

*Spital Sermons* (Christ’s Hospital).—Once the chief feature of
    the Easter festivities of this ancient foundation. _See_
    Appendix.

  1834. TROLLOPE, _History of Christ’s Hospital_ [condensed and
  annotated by the editor of _The Blue_]. All Easter festivities
  connected with the School seem to be concentrated in the SPITAL
  SERMONS. The great antiquity of those discourses may be judged from
  the fact, that at the Easter following the foundation and opening of
  the School [1552], its members were present at St. Mary Spital. At
  this their first appearance at the Spital the boys appeared in that
  costume which, with the exception of the hats, still distinguishes
  them. A custom had long prevailed, according to which some learned
  person was appointed yearly by the Bishop of London to preach at
  Paul’s Cross on Good Friday on the Passion; and on the Monday,
  Tuesday, and Wednesday following, three others were appointed in like
  manner to uphold the doctrine of the Resurrection, at the Pulpit Cross
  in the Spital. On the Sunday following, a fifth preached at Paul’s
  Cross, passed judgment on the merits of those who had preceded him,
  and concluded the ceremony with an appropriate exhortation from
  himself. What this passing of judgment meant, and what purpose it
  served, is rather hard to decide. It would almost seem as if some
  prize or reward were offered for the best sermon. The SPITAL SERMONS
  are certainly the oldest institution of their kind in London, and
  probably in England. But they have naturally been subject to great
  changes. At first there were five, two at Paul’s Cross and three at
  St. Mary Spital. Many alterations followed; for instance, the Great
  Rebellion put an end for a time both to pulpit and sermons, until the
  Restoration, when they were revived, that is, the three SPITAL SERMONS
  proper (for the judge disappears) at St. Bride’s Church, which still
  stands in Fleet Street. Nothing interrupted them again until 1797,
  when the preachers once more were removed to Christ’s Church, where
  the SERMONS, now only two in number, have been regularly delivered,
  until within the memory of many still in the school [1890] the
  Corporation reduced their number to a minimum; and now one SPITAL
  SERMON instead of five is listened to, not at St. Mary Spital, or
  Paul’s Cross, or St. Bride’s, but at Christ Church, Newgate Street.
  Though the scene has not changed since 1797, the accompanying ceremony
  has been sadly mutilated. In my [Mr. Trollope’s] time, instead of the
  subjects which were wont to be discussed from the Pulpit Cross of St.
  Mary Spital, discourses were delivered commemorative of the five
  Sister Hospitals of Christ’s Hospital, St. Thomas’, St. Bartholomew’s,
  Bridewell, and Bethlehem. This feature has almost entirely
  disappeared; the reverend preachers now pass by, or casually mention,
  the original reason for their presence in the handsome pulpit of
  Christ Church. “On each day the boys of Christ’s Hospital, with the
  legend ‘He is risen’ attached to their left shoulder, form part of the
  Civic procession; walking on the first day in the order of their
  schools, the King’s boys bearing their nautical instruments.” [These
  King’s boys are, of course, the Mathemats, who seem in earlier days,
  before the development of the Classical side, and the chances of a
  University career, to have been the most prominent part of the
  School.] They assembled on Monday in the Square of the Royal Exchange,
  and on their return were joined by the Lord Mayor and Civic
  procession, with the ladies. On Tuesday they proceeded direct to the
  Mansion House; each boy received a new sixpence, each monitor a
  shilling, and each Grecian half a guinea. [It appears that Alderman
  Thomson, whose portrait hangs in the Hall, whose name is engraven on
  the walls of the Hospital, and to whom we owe the Classical and
  Mathematical Medals, doubled the donation in every case, and his
  successors have not returned to the original amount.] The boys were
  again followed by the Civic authorities, without the ladies, to Christ
  Church, where a Junior Bishop preached on Monday, and a clergyman
  selected by the Lord Mayor (usually his chaplain) on Tuesday. But the
  most interesting feature of all was that on both occasions an anthem
  composed by one of the Grecians, and set to music by the organist, was
  sung by the children.


*Spite*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To hate: to dislike.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 235. When a
  boy suffered some injury himself, in order to spite another person; or
  having in some way injured another, received punishment, he was said
  to be SPITING GABELL. Dr. Gabell was formerly Head-master, and the
  extreme inexpediency of attempting to annoy him gave rise to the
  proverb.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SPITE. The word in
  Wykehamical usage generally connoted the frame of mind rather than the
  acts in which it finds expression. But the phrase “to SPITE Gabell”
  describes the act popularly known as “cutting off your nose to SPITE
  your face.”


*Splice*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To throw; to fling: as a missile.


*Sport*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To spread: as a baulk (or report);
    to wear: as clothes; to provide: as a feast; to indulge in:
    as smoking, walking, &c.—a general verb of action. Whence
    SPORTING ACTION = an affected manner, gesture, or gait, or
    betrayal of emotion. [_Sport_ (var. dial.) = to show, to
    exhibit.]


*Sportings*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Clothes worn at the EXEAT
    (_q.v._).

  1900. TOD, _Charterhouse_, p. 102. The splendour of Exeat garb defies
  description. It is enough to say that the Carthusian’s apparel then is
  as costly as his purse will buy, and that he calls it SPORTINGS.


*Spree*, _adj._ (Winchester).—(1) Conceited; stuck-up: of
    persons. (2) Smart; stylish; befitting a Wykehamist: of
    dress, &c. [_Spree_ (Devon) = spruce, gay.]

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 72. At the
  end of the half year we used to have large entertainments called
  “SPREE MESSES,” between Toy-time and Chapel, consisting of tea,
  coffee, muffins, cakes, &c., the funds for which were generally
  provided by fines inflicted during Toy-time for talking loud, slamming
  the door, coming in without whistling (to show that it was not a
  Master entering), improper language, &c. &c. Sometimes a SPREE MESS
  was given by the boys about to leave at the end of that Half.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SPREE.... As applied to
  juniors, uppish; inclined to assume airs, or usurp privileges not
  belonging to juniors. As applied to acts, permissible only to prefects
  or those of senior standing.


*Spreeman*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A Junior who has to fag hard.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SPREEMAN. A Commoner
  Inferior, who, in consideration of his social status or long standing
  in the School, was invested by Præfects with privileges similar to
  those enjoyed by Candle-keepers in College.


*Squab* (or *Squob*), _verb_ (King Edward’s, Birm.).—To squeeze
    by. [The foot is placed against a wall or desk, and the back
    against the victim, who is similarly treated from the
    opposite side by some one else, or pressed against a wall.]
    Hence SQUAB-UP = “push,” generally. [_Squab_ (Devon) = to
    squeeze, to knock, to beat.]


*Square.* TO SQUARE ROUND, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—To make
    room: as at a fire, &c.


*Squash*, _subs._ 1. (Stonyhurst).—A mellay (at football) of the
    two sides round the goal-posts. A goal secured in this way
    is called a “squash-goal.” Also Harrow.

  1876. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_ [Harrow], p. 312. The gravel cut
  the leather case of the ball occasionally, as well as the hands and
  faces of those who scrambled over it in a SQUASH, as that close
  _mêlée_ is called, which Rugby men know as a “scrummage,” and Etonians
  as a “rouge.”

  1885. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 144. The second law on the Code enacts
  that “no one may push, pull, charge, or trip another player.” How then
  is a SQUASH GOAL to be accounted for?

    2. (Harrow).—A game of racquets not played with a HARDER
    (_q.v._), but with an indiarubber ball, which is also called
    a SQUASH.


*Squashed-flies.* _See_ FLIES.


*Squeaky*, _adj._ (Christ’s Hospital).—High-pitched: of the
    voice. _Cf._ GRUFF.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874]. The
  voices, in our own peculiar phraseology, being divided into two
  classes—those who sang SQUEAKY and those who sang GRUFF. The monitors
  were constantly on the look-out for boys with SQUEAKY voices, and did
  any youth make himself at all prominent in this respect, down upon him
  would pounce the monitor, forthwith to _transpose_ him to the organ
  gallery, there to submit his musical abilities to a trial by the
  organist. The latter was an elderly gentleman, inclined at times to be
  rather irritable.


*Squealer*, _subs._ (Wellington).—A small boy.


*Squirm* (or *Squirt*), _subs._ (general).—An obnoxious boy.


*Squish*, _subs._ 1. (general).—Marmalade.

    2. (Winchester).—Weak tea.


*Squo*, _adj._ (Charterhouse).—SQUASH (_q.v._); as in
    SQUO-court, SQUO-ball, SQUO-bat, &c.


*Stally*, _adj._ (Derby).—Strong [? stalwart].


*Stamp*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Every one is provided with a “school
    stamp”; the name is cut on it, and this must be printed on
    all books, &c. Above the Second Fifth boys keep their own
    stamp.


*Stand.* TO STAND OUT FOR COLLEGE, _verb. phr._
    (Westminster).—To enter for a King’s scholarship. Candidates
    must be under fifteen years of age, and have been in the
    school as a town boy for not less than a year preceding.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 182. Then if he thinks proper
  he “STANDS OUT FOR COLLEGE”—or, in the old Latin phraseology, becomes
  one of the _minores candidati_. He undergoes a very severe
  examination, called the “Challenge” [_q.v._], the form of which must
  have been preserved from Queen Elizabeth’s days, and is the last
  surviving relic of the old scholastic disputations; those tournaments
  of Latin and logic, in which Queen Bess was wont to reward a
  successful champion with a purse of gold from her own virgin hand, and
  her successor, James, distributed liberally the more economical
  guerdon of royal applause and criticism.


*Standing-up Week*, _subs. phr._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 235.
  STANDING-UP WEEK—During the last week of Long Half all the boys,
  except Sixth Book and Senior Part, had to say a number of lines by
  heart in eight lessons, which they were supposed to have learned in
  the course of the previous year; this was called STANDING-UP. Marks
  were given according to merit, and these marks had a very material
  effect on the respective positions of the boys in their Parts.


*Station.* ON STATION, _adv. phr._ (Westminster).—The
    attendance, by juniors, on the games in the “Green” in Great
    Dean’s Yard, or, on a rainy day, in College.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 186. The juniors are expected
  to remain ON STATION in college for the short intervals after
  breakfast and after dinner, and at other times in the playgrounds (the
  “Green” in Dean’s Yard or Vincent Square, according to the time of
  year or the game that happens to be in season); except on decidedly
  wet days, when STATION is always in college.


*Statue* (The), _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A statue of the Virgin
    looked after by the boys. They have “Month of May”
    devotions, and write “May verses” in her honour.


*Stay.* TO STAY OUT, _verb. phr._ 1. (Eton).—To stay out of
    school. _See_ quot.

  1883. BRINSLEY-RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_. Sometimes Blazes had a
  lazy fit, and put himself on the sick-list for a day. This was called
  STAY OUT, for the reason that one had to stay in.

  1866-72. “MAC,” _Sketchy Memories of Eton_. Many things at Eton were
  called by misnomers, in the construction of which the _lucus a non
  lucendo_ principle came out very strong. Thus, when we stayed in, we
  said we were STAYING OUT; when “absence” was called, we had to be
  _present_; a _third_ of a year was called a _half_, &c. &c.

    2. (Rugby).—To go on the sick-list.


*Stedman promo*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—An unexpected (and
    probably undeserved) promotion. [Because announced in the
    lists printed by Mr. R. B. Stedman, the school bookseller at
    Godalming.]


*-ster*, _inseparable suffix_ (Winchester).—The termination
    agent: as Brockster, Mugster, Thokester, Quilster, &c.


*Stew*, _verb_ (Stonyhurst).—To study. Whence STEW-POT = a hard
    student.


*St. George*, _subs._ (Eton).—_See_ FOURTH OF JUNE.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer_, 120. Well, about the boat procession. It went
  off splendid. You know I’m in the ST. GEORGE, and Forker Major—a great
  heavy brute—is our captain, and Tipkins is steerer.


*Sticking-up*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 236.
  STICKING-UP.—On the last three Fridays of each Half, a boy was
  selected by appointment of Commoner Præfects and Course-keeper, and
  placed on the top of TOYS (_q.v._) in their Hall, and was pelted with
  PONTOS (_q.v._) by the rest. The following PEALS (_q.v._) were chanted
  previously, one on each day: “Locks and Keys,” “Boots and Leathers,”
  and “Gomer Hats.”


*Stick-ups*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Stand-up, or high collars: as
    opposed to “turn-downs.” The rules as to collars are very
    intricate, and differ in various Houses. At Charterhouse
    STICK-UPS are not permissible until the end of the first
    year.


*Stinks*, _subs._ (general).—Chemistry. Also as a nickname for a
    lecturer thereon.


*Stizzle*, _verb_ (Tonbridge).—To cane.


*Stodge*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—The inside of a roll; the
    crumb of new bread.

    _Verb_ (Tonbridge).—To hurt.


*Stodger*, _subs._ (Charterhouse and Tonbridge).—A penny bun.


*Stone* (The), _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital: obsolete).—The
    Steward’s table in Hall. TO GO TO THE STONE = to go up for
    trial, judgment, and sentence for misconduct.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [_The Blue_, Aug. 1874]. With
  respect to misconduct out of school hours, the several monitors were
  the police, and the Steward the sole judge. When first appointed, the
  young monitors displayed excessive zeal in the discovery of
  delinquencies, and would call out with as much severity as it was
  possible to throw into the voice of a youth of fourteen, “Go to THE
  STONE, you, sir!” “THE STONE” was the name given to the Steward’s
  table in the Hall, where offenders were tried, judgment delivered, and
  sentence carried out, immediately after meals. The mildest punishment
  consisted of caning on the open hand (ironically termed “cakes”), and
  next in severity was flogging with the birch (called “brushing”); and
  Fate, with a grim sense of humour which we failed to appreciate at the
  time, decreed that the head beadle in our time, who was appointed to
  administer the said brushings and cakes, should bear the appropriate
  name of Honey.


*Stonyhurst-cricket* (or *Football*). _See_ Appendix.


*Stop.* TO STOP OUT, _verb. phr._ (Harrow and Charterhouse).—To
    absent oneself from school: at Harrow, through
    indisposition.


*Stopping-up*, subs. (Stonyhurst).—An extra time of study
    allowed to elder boys when the rest have gone to bed: _e.g._
    “I am going to STOPPING-UP to-night.”


*Strangers’ Place*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The
    guest-rooms. When a boy had friends staying in the College
    he was said to be “in the STRANGERS’ PLACE.” _Cf._ PLACE.


*Straw*,_ subs._ 1. (Harrow).—A straw hat worn by the whole
    school all the year round, except on Sundays and at games.
    The ELEVEN STRAW = a speckled black-and-white straw hat worn
    by the Cricket Eleven.

    2. (Rugby).—For two years after his first term (during which
    a silk hat or “topper” was _de rigueur_) a boy wears a
    black-and-white speckled straw hat with a black ribbon. Each
    House has its own distinctive ribbon. At the end of his
    third year a boy could “take” his “white straw,” but he was
    not expected to do this unless he were a SWELL (_q.v._).

    Also _see_ CLEAN STRAW.


*Strawer*, _subs._ (general).—A straw hat.


*Stretch*, _subs._ (University).—A walk.


*Strive*, _verb_ (Christ’s Hospital).—To write with care: _see_
    SCRUB. _E.g._ “Copy this!” “Shall I STRIVE, Sir, or ‘scrub’
    it down?”


*Stub*, _verb_ (Felsted).—To kick a football about.

  1888. _Felstedian_, Dec., p. 98. Now these hollow globes [footballs]
  flying through the air, collide with their sandals, and this colliding
  they call STUBBING. _Ibid._ (Nov. 1896, 153). Boys are fined for
  STUBBING on a forty higher than their own.

  1895. _Felstedian_, June, p. 104. Among plausible etymologies it is
  attempted to derive STUB from “the sound made by a stubbed football.”
  ... But the word STUB deserves to be rescued from its fate. I had
  always imagined it to be an East Anglian word for “kick,” but it is,
  to the best of my belief, obsolete in England.... A contributor to
  _Notes and Queries_, writing on a totally different subject, quoted
  the following words from a speech by an American judge: “As a
  barefooted boy I STUBBED my chapped toes over a rough New England
  farm.” [_Stub_ is commonly dialectical, in the sense of “to grub.”]


*Stuckling*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A kind of flat pastry made of
    the current year’s apples and dried currants.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. STUCKLING. An apple pasty,
  thin, somewhat half circular in shape, and not made in a dish.

  1883. TROLLOPE, _What I Remember_.... STUCKLING was a kind of flat
  pastry made of chopped apples and currants. And the speciality of it
  was that the apples must be that year’s apples. They used to be sent
  up from Devonshire or Cornwall, and sometimes were with difficulty
  obtained.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. STUCKLING. A pudding at
  Election dinner, made of meat, apple, and carraway.


*Study-place*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A study. _Cf._ PLACE.


*Stuggy*,_ adj._ (general).—Thick-set. [STUGGY (Devon) = thick,
    stout.]


*Stumper*, _subs._ (Tonbridge).—Small cricket played with a
    stump.


*Stumps*, _subs._ (Harrow).—Cricket played with a stump and a
    soft ball.


*Styx*, _subs._ (The Leys).—A urinal. _Cf._ HADES.


*Sub-minister*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—The superior responsible
    for the health of the house. _See_ MINISTER.


*Substance*, _subs._ (Westminster).—_See_ SHADOW.


*Suck*, _subs._ (University).—A parasite; a toady.


*Suction*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Sweetmeats.


*Sudden-death*, _subs._ (University).—A crumpet.

    ADSUM (_q.v._).


*Summer Quarter*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—_See_ LONG QUARTER.


*Superann*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Superannuate.


*Superannuate*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 237.
  SUPERANNUATE.—A boy who was obliged to leave at Election, owing to his
  being past eighteen years of age. FOUNDERS (_q.v._) were not
  SUPERANNUATE till they were twenty-five.


*Surly Hall* (Eton).—A public-house on the right bank of the
    Thames, some three and a half miles from Windsor. _See_
    FOURTH OF JUNE.


*Sur-master*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar: obsolete).—The second
    master; the “Usher.” [There is now no second in command.]


*Sus*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—The remains of a
    Præfect’s tea: a fag’s perquisite.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 237.
  SUS.—The Juniors’ tea: generally drunk out of a pint cup when in bed.


*Swank*, _verb_ (general).—To work hard. [O.E. _Swinke_ = to
    labour.] Hence SWANKER = a hard worker. _See_ SWINK.

*Swell*, _subs._ 1. (Eton and Harrow). _See_ quot.

  18[?]. T. R. OLIPHANT, _Eton College_.... It is very hard to define
  exactly what is meant by a SWELL at Eton; but it usually implies a boy
  who, brought into notice either by athletic prowess or scholarship, or
  high standing in the school, by this means becomes acquainted with the
  leading members of the school, and is found on acquaintance to develop
  considerable social qualities, which make him hand and glove with all
  the Eton magnates.

    2. (Rugby).—The word SWELL (says Mr. LEES KNOWLES) had an
    indefinite, but well understood, meaning in the school. A
    member of the school “twenty,” or “fifteen” as it is now, or
    a member of the eleven, was, for instance, a SWELL.

    _Verb_ (Winchester).—To bathe; to wash.

    (Winchester) to wash by throwing water over the body.

  worlde’s good, For which men SWINCKE and sweat incessantly.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. SWINK.... The former [to
  sweat] is the primary Wykehamical meaning: SWINK and _sweat_ have
  therefore changed places.


*Swipes*, _subs._ 1. (Stonyhurst).—The boy-servant who serves
    out beer at dinner.

    2. (Harrow).—Supper.

    TO BE SWIPED, _verb. phr._ (Harrow).—To be birched.


*Swish*, _verb_ (Eton and Charterhouse).—To flog. Hence SWISHING
    = a beating.

  _c._ 1889. _Illustrated London News._ Flogging, or, as it is called at
  Eton, SWISHING, is to be abolished at that aristocratic seminary.

  inelegantly terms the more important part of instruction he receives

    as _verb_.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 237. TAG....
  When a player has kicked the ball well forward, and has followed it,
  if it was then kicked back again behind him by the other side, he was
  then obliged to return to his original position with his own side. If
  the ball had, in the meantime, been again kicked in front of him,
  before he regained his position, and he was to kick it, it would be
  considered unfair, and he would be said TO TAG.


*Tails*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The swallow-tailed coats worn by all
    in the Upper School, and (as “charity-tails”) by all in the

    (_q.v._).

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” That

  keep off till the last moment as a sign of servitude to shew that I am
  only a junior, and then scramble in to chapel somehow, very likely
  late, with an impot in store from my form master, and a licking from

    as _verb_ = to lie in bed late. [Prov. Eng. _thoky_ =

    pleasure; THOKESTER = an idler.

  1847. HALLIWELL, _Archaic Words_, s.v. THOKISH. Slothful; sluggish.

  and a half remedy.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 465. He attributed his

    water and then baked.

  School-house court.

*Tin-gloves*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 54. But
  there were other ordeals that were not quite so harmless. Green was
  liable to be asked whether he possessed a pair of TIN-GLOVES. As this
  article does not generally form part of a boy’s outfit, Bully would
  proceed to furnish him with a pair in the following manner:—Taking a
  half consumed stick from the fire, he would draw the “red-hot end”
  down the back of Green’s hand between each of the knuckles to the
  wrist, and having produced three satisfactory lines of blisters would
  then make two or three transverse lines across. A scientifically
  fitted pair of gloves of this description was generally, if not
  pleasant wear, of great durability.


*Tin-tab*, _subs._ (Dulwich).—The carpenter’s shop.


*Tip*, _subs._ (Felsted).—1. A false report.

  1890. _Felstedian_, Feb., p. 3. Some one ventured to suggest that it
  was all a beastly TIP.... Many would just like to get hold of the
  fellow that started the TIP.

  1893. _Felstedian_, Dec., p. 143. Nor is it credible that he stands in
  need of those useful and entertaining scraps of general information to
  which we apply the term “TIPS” in our ordinary conversation.

  1895. _Felstedian_, April, p. 45. TIP.—“Tip” and “tip-spreading,”
  expressing with that brevity which is the soul of wit, our horror of
  scandal and scandal-mongering, again defy analysis.

    2. (Felsted).—A foolish mistake in translating, &c.

*Toe-fit-tie*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—_See_ quot.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 84, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” I
  remember now; it was that brute A—— who “to FITTI”-ed me last
  night.... For the benefit of the uninitiated let me explain the _modus
  operandi_ and its etymology: it is nothing more or less than the
  commencement of a line in the old familiar “_As in præsenti perfectum,
  format in avi_,” which we used to learn, “_to fit-ti_,” in reference
  to verbs of the third conjugation, transferred from the similarity of
  sound to the school-boy’s toe; it consisted in tying a running noose
  on a piece of string, cunningly turning up the bed-clothes at the
  foot, putting it round the big toe of an unconscious sleeper, running
  the noose up tight, and pulling till the victim followed the direction
  of string from the pain, getting farther and farther out of bed and
  nearer and nearer the floor, till mercifully released.


*Togger*, _subs._ (Oxford).—A TORPID (_q.v._) boat-race.

  1894. _Felstedian_, Dec., p. 181. Wiltshire will probably row in one

    tolls 101 times each evening at ten minutes past nine

    marks the time for the closing of the College gates. “TOM”
    is one of the lions of Oxford. It formerly belonged to
    Oseney Abbey, and weighs about 17,000 pounds, being more
    than double the weight of the great bell of St. Paul’s.]

    τομή, a section.]


*Tonkabout*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—The hitting up of catches

    Originally shout, then tout, whence TOOT. “Shout” = to stand
    treat.]

*Torch-race*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—Formerly, part of

    and along the wall of the Close up to the old White Hart
    Inn, where breakfast was prepared before the chaises started
    for their various destinations. This curious TORCH-RACE
    subsequently gave way to a race of the seniors in sedan
    chairs.

  satisfaction to see their brother pulling in one of the fifteen
  TORPIDS that followed immediately in the wake of the other boats.

  1889. _Felstedian_, Feb., p. 11. After the TORPIDS will come the
  Clinker Forms—an institution hitherto unknown in Oxford.

  1900. _Westminster Gazette_, 21st Feb., 8. 3. Oxford University
  TORPIDS. These races were concluded to-day.


*Tosh*, _subs._ (general).—A foot-tub; a bath. Also, as _verb_ =
    to throw water over a person: _e.g._ “He TOSHED his house
    beak by mistake, and got three hundred.” Hence TOSH-POND
    (Royal Military Academy) = the bathing-pond. [That is,
    “toe-wash.”]


*Tosher*, _subs._ (Oxford).—An unattached student.


*Tosh-soap*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—Cheese.

  last “all up,” there is a TOW or continuous run of from one to three

*Town and Gown*, _sub. phr._ (University).—The townsmen _v._ the
    members of the University. [In her young days the position
    of the University was one of perpetual conflict—with the
    town, the Jews, the Friars, and the Papal Court.]

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, II. iii. TOWN AND GOWN disturbances
  are of considerable antiquity. Fuller and Matthew Paris give accounts
  of some which occurred as early as the year 1238. These disputes not
  unfrequently terminated fatally to some of the combatants. One of the
  most serious TOWN AND GOWN rows on record took place on the day of St.
  Scholastica the Virgin, February 10, 1345, when several lives were
  lost on either side. The University was at that time in the Lincoln
  diocese; and Grostête, the bishop, placed the townspeople under an
  interdict, from which they were not released till 1357, and then only
  on condition that the mayor and sixty of the chief burgesses should on
  every anniversary of the day of St. Scholastica, attend St. Mary’s
  Church and offer up mass for the soul of the slain scholars, and
  should also individually present an offering of one penny at the high
  altar. They, moreover, paid a yearly fine of 100 marks to the
  University, with the penalty of an additional fine of the same sum for
  every omission in attending at St. Mary’s. This continued up to the
  time of the Reformation, when it gradually fell into abeyance. In the
  fifteenth year of Elizabeth, however, the University asserted their
  claim to all arrears. The matter being brought to trial, it was
  decided that the town should continue the annual fine and penance,
  though the arrears were forgiven. The fine was yearly paid on the 10th
  of February up to our own time; the mayor and chief burgesses attended
  at St. Mary’s and made the offering at the conclusion of the litany,
  which, on that occasion, was read from the altar. This was at length
  put an end to by Convocation in the year 1825.

  1899. HEYWOOD, _Guide to Oxford_. The TOWN AND GOWN rows, as occasions
  for displays of physical force, lasted until quite recent times, as
  readers of _Verdant Green_ and _Tom Brown at Oxford_ will know.
  Nowadays, however, they are happily unknown.


*Townee* (or *Towner*), _subs._ (general).—_See_ CAD.


*Towney* (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ HOUSEY.

  1887. _The Blue_, Nov. Thus, a little farther on, mention is made of
  the time when a boy leaves the School. The consequent change of dress
  might be vulgarly expressed by “exchanging HOUSEYS FOR TOWNEYS,” but
  our author is before all things refined. “The boy is at liberty to
  exchange the garb of the house for one more congenial to modern
  taste.”


*Town-lout*, _subs._ (Rugby).—A scholar residing in the town
    with his parents.


*Toys*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A bureau—desk and book-case
    combined. Whence TOY-TIME (or TOYS) = evening preparation
    (in College) and (in Commoners) all time so spent.

  1440. _Prompt. Parv._ _Teye_, of a cofyr or forcer.

  1881. PASCOE, _Everyday Life in our Public Schools_. The clock
  striking seven each junior retires to his TOYS or bureau for an hour
  and a half, during what is known as TOYTIME, when the work of the next
  morning and the week’s composition have to be prepared.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. TOYS.... The expression
  TOY-TIME suggests that the “s” has been added. If TOYS has not
  descended from this word [teye], it must have been transferred from
  the contents of the toys, and mean simply _one’s belongings_.


*Trades*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ quot. and
    PUBLIC-SUPPING.

  1900. _Daily Telegraph_, 16th March, “London Day by Day.” After the
  boys had concluded their simple repast of tea and bread-and-butter,
  they formed up two-and-two, and bowed to the Lord Mayor, the different
  wards being headed by the TRADES, as the boys who carry the
  candlesticks, the bread-basket, table-cloth, and cutlery are termed.


*Travelling-scholarship* (or *Fellowship*), _subs._
    (University).—RUSTICATION (_q.v._).


*Treacle-bolly*, _subs._ (Marlborough). A walk by the Kennett
    close to the College. [So called from the cottage of a
    miller so nick-named.]


*Tree of Knowledge, The* (Charterhouse).—The tree under which
    books, &c., are piled in the interval between second school
    and dinner (say 12.30 to 1.15), while run-about in winter
    and cricket-nets or position drill in summer is engaged in.


*Treer*, _subs._ (Durham: obsolete).—A boy who avoids organised
    games, but plays a private game with one or two friends.
    [Presumably because played by the trees at the side of the
    ground.]


*Trek*, _verb_ (Durham).—To run.


*Trencher*, _subs._ 1. (Winchester).—A square wooden platter: in
    use in College.

    2. (general).—A college cap; a MORTAR-BOARD (_q.v._).


*Trial*, _subs._ (Harrow).—An examination. Whence TRIALS = the
    examinations at the end of the summer and winter terms.


*Tribune*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A large pew in
    ante-chapel: reserved for ladies.


*Tripos*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—A word dating from the sixteenth
    century, and used successively in a number of different
    senses. At first it was applied to the stool on which the
    champion of the University sat at the disputations held at
    the admission of Bachelors of Arts to their degree; then it
    was transferred to the Bachelor himself; still later to the
    humorous, or, in some cases, scurrilous, speech with which
    “Mr. Tripos” opened the proceedings, and to the verses of
    the Bachelors at the Acts. The honours-lists were printed
    (about 1847-8) on the backs of these verses, and so
    tripos came to mean an honour-list, and, last of all, the
    examination itself. Until the year 1824 there was only one
    tripos, the Mathematical; and up to 1850 only those who had
    obtained honours in mathematics were admitted to the
    Classical examination. The degree was not given for that
    examination till a few years later.

  1877. WORDSWORTH, _Scholæ Academicæ_, 20. Such interest as is now
  attached to them belongs rather to the verses than to the list of the
  several TRIPOSES (for the name has now at last come to signify degree
  examinations) which have been circulated already severally.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 9. I’m seriously thinking of
  chucking my TRIPOS and taking up the History Special.


*Trotter*, _subs._ (University).—A tailor’s assistant who goes
    on round for orders.


*Truck-house*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—The Recreation
    rooms.

  1882. _Stonyhurst Mag._, i. 12, “Rummagings amongst our Records.”
  Grammar and Great Figures on their Declamation day ... were exempted
  from studies and allowed something of a collation in the TRUCK-HOUSE.


*Tub*, _subs._ 1. (University).—A boat broad in the beam, used
    by novices. Hence TUBBING = boating; to GET TUBBED = to be
    taught to row.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_.... So to the river he next day went,
  and made his first essay in a TUB.

  1889. _Morning Advertiser._ If “up” at the University, we will
  probably pass our time between “grinding hard” and TUBBING on the
  river.

  1898. _Stonyhurst Mag._, Dec., p. 149, “Life at Oxford.” Rowing is
  naturally a great attraction to many freshmen, and every College is
  always on the look-out for new oarsmen. What one does is to get
  “TUBBED,” that is, one is taught to row by members of the College
  eight in boats that are too TUB-like to be easily capsized.

    2. (Winchester).—A chest in Hall into which DISPARS (_q.v._)
    not taken by the boys were put.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 79. In front
  of the screen stood “TUB,” from which the Præfect of that Ilk took his
  title; it was a strong painted oak chest, with a lid, about two feet
  high.... As will be seen, it was simply impossible for the Juniors to
  be up to time, the consequence of which was that more than half the
  dinners were not taken; these were thrown into “TUB” at the end of
  Hall, whence they were ultimately taken away by some poor women, and I
  always understood (though I am not certain that such was the case)
  that the “Præfect of TUB” got a certain sum for each “Dispar” not
  taken, and so had a direct interest in managing that as many as
  possible should go without their dinner. I will now explain the
  absence of the Juniors; immediately the Præfects were seated, the
  whole Hall resounded with shouts of “Junior—Junior—Junior,” rising in
  savageness of tone, as the supply became exhausted; in five minutes
  all the Juniors were darting wildly about in all directions, executing
  orders received from their lords and masters; some to Colson’s hatch
  for salt, or down in the cellar for beer, back to school for something
  forgotten, into chambers for a pint cup, down to the kitchen for
  gravy, &c. &c.

  1867. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_, p. 23. Until the last few years
  the “præfect of TUB” (whose duty it was to examine the quality of the
  meat sent in by the college butcher, and after dinner to see to the
  proper collection and distribution of the remains) retained his title.


*Tub-mess*, _subs._ (Winchester).—The table at which the Senior
    Præfects sat in Hall.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Tuck*, _subs._ (general).—Edibles of all kinds, but
    particularly pastry. Hence TUCK-SHOP = a pastry-cook’s.


*Tuck-parcel*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A hamper from home: the
    word is now becoming obsolete.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, I. vi. Come along down to
  Sally Harrowell’s; that’s our school-house TUCK-SHOP. She bakes such
  shining murphies. _Ibid._ The slogger looks rather sodden, as if he
  didn’t take much exercise and ate too much TUCK.


*Tug*, _subs._ (Eton).—A Colleger; a scholar on the foundation.
    Whence TUGGERY = College.

  1881. PASCOE, _Everyday Life in our Public Schools_.... The long
  looked-for St. Andrew’s Day arrives, when the great match of
  collegers, or, as the small oppidan would term it, TUGS, and oppidans
  is to be played.

  1883. BRINSLEY-RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_.... My interlocutor was
  a red-headed freckled little boy of eleven, who had come from Aberdeen
  “to try for TUGGERY,” that is, to try and pass in to the foundation as
  a King’s Scholar.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 52. The Collegers did not always fare as
  bravely as they do now, either at board or bed. Terrible tales of
  their manner of life may be read.... Perhaps the recollections of that
  time caused the disrespect, almost bordering on contempt, with which
  the Oppidans used for many years to regard the _Togati_, or
  gown-wearing boys. [_Note._—I suppose there is not much doubt that the
  nickname of TUG by which the Collegers used to go among the rest of
  the school, was derived from the _toga_ they wore.]

    _Adj._ (Winchester) = stale; ordinary; vapid; common. Whence
    TUGS = stale news; TUG-CLOTHES = everyday clothes; TUG-JAW =
    wearisome talk.


*Tui*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Tuition.


*Tumbies*, _subs._ (University).—Ablutions.


*Tund*, _verb_ (Winchester).—To thrash. Whence TUNDING = a
    thrashing. [Lat. _tundere_.]

  1881. PASCOE, _Everyday Life in Our Public Schools_.... I never heard
  of any case in Eton like the TUNDING which, some years ago, brought
  our mother-school into disagreeable notice.

  1883. TROLLOPE, _What I Remember_.... It was the prefect of hall who
  ordered the infliction of a public TUNDING.... The following simple
  and truthful statement of what a public TUNDING was may enable those
  who take an interest in the matter to form some reasonable opinion
  whether the infliction of such punishment were a good or a bad
  thing.... Some dozen or so of boys, who had the best capacities for
  the performance, were appointed by him for the purpose, and the whole
  assembly stood around the daïs, while the hymn _Te de profundis_ was
  sung. When all were thus assembled, and before the singers commenced,
  the culprit who had been sentenced to a TUNDING stepped out, pulled
  off his gown, and received from the hands of one deputed by the
  “prefect of hall,” and armed with a tough, pliant, ground-ash stick, a
  severe beating.

  _c._ 1890. _Punch_ [Confession by a Wykehamist]. I like to be TUNDED
  twice a day, And swished three times a week.


*Turf*, _subs._ 1. (Winchester).—The pitch: at cricket. The
    field is “long grass.”

    2. (Felsted).—The cricket-field.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 75. There are (or were) six cricket
  pitches on TURF.

    _Verb._ 1. (Derby).—To send to bed at bed-time: used of
    Præpostors.

    2. (Marlborough).—To chastise.


*Turl* (The), _subs._ (Oxford).—Turl Street. [Formerly a narrow
    opening through the city wall into the High Street.]


*Turn.* TO TURN UP, _verb. phr._ (Marlborough).—To chastise:
    with cane, stick, or fives-bat.

    TO BE TURNED, _verb. phr._ (Harrow and Dulwich).—To be
    ploughed in a _vive voce_ translation lesson.


*Twank*, _verb_ (Durham).—To cane. _See_ LAM and YARK. [_Twank_
    (East) = to give a smart slap with the flat of the hand.]


*Tweaker*, _subs._ (Felsted: obsolete).—A catapult.


*Twelve.* AFTER TWELVE, _subs. phr._ (Eton).—From noon till two
    P.M.

  1861. WHYTE-MELVILLE, _Good for Nothing_, p. 39. I used to visit him
  regularly in the dear old college from the AFTER TWELVE.

  1864. _Eton School-days_, vi. I tell you plainly, if you are not in
  Sixpenny AFTER TWELVE, I will do my best to give you a hiding wherever
  I meet you.

  1883. BRINSLEY-RICHARDS, _Seven Years at Eton_. Croppie, who
  abominated all laws and delighted in transgressions, resolved to go to
  the fair, and without difficulty he persuaded the Pug and me to join
  him. One day AFTER TWELVE the three of us passed over Windsor Bridge
  in the same condition as the “bold adventurers” alluded to in Gray’s
  Ode.

    THE TWELVE, _subs._ (Harrow).—_See_ quot., and Appendix.

  1899. _Public School Mag._, Dec., p. 446. The working system of the
  school has lately been slightly altered. Above the two sixth forms
  there has been placed a Head-master’s “TWELVE,” with the object of
  training the first TWELVE on the classical side for ’Varsity life.
  They are only in school about three hours a day, but have to get
  through a tough amount of work at their leisure.


*Twelve Apostles*, _subs._ 1. (Cambridge).—The last twelve in
    the Mathematical Tripos.

  1785. GROSE, _Vulg. Tongue_, s.v. PLUCK.... These unfortunate fellows
  are designated by many opprobrious appellations, such as the TWELVE
  APOSTLES, the Legion of Honour, Wise Men of the East, &c.

    2. (Stonyhurst).—The twelve first Stonyhurst boys.

  1887. _Stonyhurst Mag._, iii. 90. Stonyhurst boys of all past times
  since the coming of the original “TWELVE APOSTLES” ... will have
  noticed once a year, about Eastertide, a curious notice ... giving
  warning of an approaching meeting of the Court Leet.

*Twenty-two and Twenty-two*, _subs. phr._ (Winchester:
    obsolete).—Football: twenty-two a side.

    marked by a creeper having grown round it.






*Ulula*, _subs._ (Manchester Grammar).—The school magazine. [The
    Owl is the school crest, as it was that of the founder, Hugh
    Oldham, Bishop of Exeter.]


*Under Fire* (Westminster).—_See_ UPPER FIRE.


*Under-green* (Charterhouse).—Formerly the present big or match
    football ground: now the Under’s cricket-ground.


*Under School* (Harrow).—_See_ UPPER SCHOOL.


*Under Selectæ* (Harrow).—_See_ UPPER SCHOOL.


*Union*, _subs._ (University).—An undergrad’s debating society.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 15. I think I shall speak at the
  UNION soon.... I tried on Tuesday last, but I couldn’t catch the
  President’s eye.


*Univ*, _subs._ (Oxford).—University College.


*Up*, _adv._ (Harrow).—In school. TO BE UP TO ANY ONE AT SECOND
    SCHOOL = to go to any one for work at 10 or 11 o’clock.


*Upper Club* (Eton).—_See_ PLAYING-FIELDS.


*Upper (Middle, or Under) Fire*, _subs._ (Westminster).—The
    three fire-places, under former arrangements, in the present
    dormitory.


*Upper School*, _subs._ (Harrow).—In 1770 (the first year of the
    printed BILLS (_q.v._) of the school) the school comprised
    the monitors—their numbers varied from four to ten—the Fifth
    Form, the Shell, and the Fourth and Third Forms: these
    ranked as the UPPER SCHOOL. The UNDER SCHOOL was divided in
    a very peculiar fashion; there was first the “Scan and
    Prove” class, then the “Ovid,” the “Phædrus,” the “Upper
    Selectæ,” “Under Selectæ,” “Nomenclature,” “Grammar,” and
    “Accidence.”... At present there are, besides the monitors
    (fifteen in number), an Upper and Lower Sixth, three
    separate divisions of the Fifth, two “Removes,” three
    “Shells,” and three Fourths. On the Modern Side are one
    Sixth, three Fifths, one “Remove,” three Shells, and three
    Fourths.


*Upper Selectæ* (Harrow).—_See_ UPPER SCHOOL.


*Upper Sixpenny* (Eton).—_See_ PLAYING-FIELDS.


*Uskites* (Charterhouse).—_See_ OUT-HOUSES.






*Vac*, _subs._ (University).—Vacation.

  1891. _Harry Fludyer at Cambridge_, 2. I can’t make out why the Pater
  is always so crusty about Rover. He told me every day last VAC he
  wouldn’t have his house over-run with dogs.


*Valet*, subs. (Winchester).—Every Præfect had a Junior in
    Chambers who acted in this capacity, made his tea or coffee,
    carried his things through from Chambers to School and back
    again, and looked after him in general.—MANSFIELD (_c._
    1840).


*Varmint*, _adj._ (old University).—Good; spruce.


*Varmint-man*, _subs._ (Cambridge: obsolete). _See_ quots.

  1803. _Gradus ad Cantab._ A VARMINT-MAN spurns a scholarship, would
  consider it a degradation to be a Fellow.

  1827. _Alma Mater...._ The handsome man, my friend and pupil, was
  naturally enough a bit of a swell, or VARMINT-MAN.


*’Varsity*, _subs._ (Oxford and Cambridge).—The accepted
    corruption of University.


*’Varsity-tit* (or *Tit*), subs. (Durham).—A student of Durham
    University: in contempt.

    Vaughan.

    master’s approach; the equivalent of _cave_, which is not
    used at Felsted. Also TO KEEP VIC.


*Vice* (The), _subs._ (University).—The Vice-Chancellor.


*Vile-child*, _subs._ (Eton).—_See_ quot., and Appendix.

  1866-72. _Sketchy Memories of Eton...._ Being called a VILE-CHILD, the
  which I subsequently learnt was a very frequent term of mild reproach,
  and had no particular reference to the age of the individual to whom
  it was addressed. As a proof of this I may add that, being at Eton for
  the Winchester Match in 1883, I (_moi-qui-vous-parle_, height 6 feet 2
  inches, and weight 14 stone 7 lbs.) was called a VILE-CHILD for being
  on a committee to oppose a certain obnoxious Indian Bill! I wasn’t
  sorry when tea was over, although many most pleasant evenings did I
  afterwards spend in that room.


*Vocab*, _subs._ (Charterhouse).—A vocabulary.


*Vol*, _adj._ (Harrow).—Voluntary: _e.g._ VOL-GYM.


*Voluntary*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A copy of verses written
    occasionally by some of the boys in Sixth Book and Senior
    Part _ex proprio motu_.—MANSFIELD (_c._ 1840).


*Vulgus*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A Latin epigram: four
    or six lines long. Hence VULGUS-BOOK = a CRIB (_q.v._).

  1883. TROLLOPE, _What I Remember_.... The mention of a VULGUS requires
  some explanation. Every inferior, _i.e._ non-prefect, in the school
  was required every night to produce a copy of verses of from two to
  six lines on a given theme—four or six lines for the upper classes,
  two for the lowest. This was independent of a weekly verse task of
  greater length, and was called a VULGUS, I suppose, because
  everybody—the VULGUS—had to do it.

  1856. HUGHES, _Tom Brown’s School-days_, II. iii. The VULGUS (commonly
  supposed to have been established by William of Wykeham at Winchester,
  and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for the sake of the lines which
  were learnt by heart with it than for its own intrinsic value, as I’ve
  always understood), ... is a short exercise in Greek or Latin verse,
  on a given subject, the minimum number of lines being fixed for each
  form.... At Rugby VULGUS and lines were the first lesson every other
  day in the week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; and ... it is
  obvious ... that the master of each Form had to set one hundred and
  fourteen subjects every year.... Now, human nature being prone to
  repeat itself, it will not be wondered that the masters gave the same
  subjects sometimes over again after a certain lapse of time. To meet
  and rebuke this bad habit of the masters, the school-boy mind, with
  its accustomed ingenuity, had invented an elaborate system of
  tradition. Almost every boy kept his own VULGUS written out in a book
  ... duly handed down from boy to boy, till ... popular boys, in whose
  hands bequeathed VULGUS-BOOKS have accumulated, are prepared with
  three or four VULGUSES on any subject in heaven or earth, or in “more
  worlds than one,” which an unfortunate master can pitch upon.... The
  only objection to the traditionary method of doing your VULGUSES was,
  the risk that the successions might have become confused, and so that
  you and another follower of traditions should show up the same
  identical VULGUS some fine morning; in which case, when it happened,
  considerable grief was the result.






*Waffle*, _verb_ (Durham).—To talk nonsense. [North dial.
    _waffle_ = to wave, to fluctuate; _waffler_ (Camb.) = a
    person who is very weak; _waffy_ (Linc.) = insipid.]


*Walking-days*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst: obsolete).—Several days
    allowed to a new boy during which he was initiated into the
    ways of the house by an old boy.


*Wall*, _subs._ (Eton).—_See_ quot.

  1890. _Great Public Schools_, 26. There are, as is well known, two
  [football] games played at Eton—one at the WALL, the other in the
  FIELD. The first is only played by a very limited number of boys, for
  there is but one WALL; the game is of a mysterious and intricate
  nature, and the uninitiated spectator cannot as a rule even see how a
  point (called a SHY) is obtained. Indeed were it not for the
  time-honoured match between Collegers and Oppidans on St. Andrew’s
  Day, the game would probably become obsolete.... The Eton FIELD game
  has, in the opinion of the writer [the Rev. Sydney R. James], merits,
  as a game for boys, superior to those of any other kind of football.
  In it speed and skilful dribbling and accurate kicking have their due
  success, but strength and dogged perseverance and pluck are not left
  out in the cold.

    _Verb_ (Oxford).—To confine to College.


*Wallyford*, _subs._ (Loretto).—The usual run on a wet whole
    school-day: about 3-1/2 miles. _See_ LONG WALLYFORD.


*Wanker*, _subs._ (Felsted).—A bloater. [From
    “stinker”—“stwanker”—“wanker.”]

  1892. _Felstedian_, Oct., 105. My name it is “WANKER”; a leaner or
  lanker, Salter or ranker, fish never swam. _Ibid._, June 1897, p. 100.
  He sniffs. “’Eugh, WANKERS again.”


*Warden*, subs. (Winchester).—See quot.

  _c._ 1840. MANSFIELD, _School-Life at Winchester_ (1866), 27. The
  chief of the whole establishment is the WARDEN, who has nothing to do
  with the teaching of the boys; he admits and when necessary expels
  them, confers on them the dignity of “Præfect,” listens to their
  complaints, and, in fact, in all matters appertaining to the
  management of the school and the society is omnipotent.


*Wash*, _subs._ (Derby).—School tea or coffee. _See_ ROCK.


*Washing-drawer*, _subs._ (Winchester).—In College, a box to
    hold toilet requisites.


*Washing-stool*, _subs._ (Winchester).—In College, a Præfect’s
    table.

  1881. _Felstedian_, Nov., p. 74, “A Day’s Fagging at Winchester.” I
  remember that the Senior Præfect is going to get up to mug early
  before chapel, and I have to call him and take his WASHING-STOOL (a
  rough wooden table generally used for putting washing basins on,
  which, when covered with a cloth, serves as a writing-table) out into
  Chamber Court.... Here let me observe that only the præfects have
  separate basins to wash in; the juniors use the two stone conduits.


*Watch*, _subs._ (Westminster).—A junior who has to remain in
    College during play-hours to answer inquiries, receive
    messages, and so forth, performing, in fact, the duties of a
    servant.


*Watch.* TO WATCH OUT, _verb. phr._ (Winchester).—To field: at
    cricket.


*Water*, _subs._ (Westminster).—Boating.

  1881. PASCOE, _Everyday Life in Our Public Schools_. Boating, or
  WATER, as it is called at Westminster, is in a very flourishing
  condition.


*Weekites* (Charterhouse).—_See_ OUT-HOUSES.


*Westminster Customs.* _See_ CAP; CHALLENGE; EARLY; PLAY; MONOS;
    PANCAKE; SHADOW; SILVER-PENCE and WESTMINSTER PLAY. Besides
    these are others worthy of mention:—

    1. THE COLLEGE WAISTCOAT.—A remarkable and original service
    was, up to the date of the Public Schools Commission,
    exacted of a Westminster junior. He was supposed to be a
    treasury of small conveniences for his seniors’ use in and
    out of school. He wore a college waistcoat of peculiar
    pattern, in the pockets of which he had to carry about and
    produce immediately on legal demand—the items are recorded
    in the published evidence—two penknives, two pieces of
    india-rubber, two pencils, two pieces of sealing-wax, two
    pieces of pen-string, two dips (_q.v._), two dip-corks, two
    wedges, two pieces of gutta-percha (for putting on the
    points of foils), and any number of pens. Besides, he had to
    carry a portfolio containing a sufficiency of “quarterns” of
    paper.

    2. LATIN FORMULÆ.—Quaint old Latin formulæ continued in use
    at Westminster, unchanged since its earliest foundation.
    While the school is at morning lesson, the _monitor ostii_
    (_see_ MONOS) watches the clock, and at half-past eleven
    comes to the monitor of school and announces the time. The
    monitor goes to the head-master’s desk, makes his bow, and
    says, “_Sesqui est undecima_.” At a quarter to twelve he
    makes the further announcement, “_Instat duodecima_.”
    When twelve o’clock has struck he says again, “_Sonuit
    duodecima_;” at a quarter-past twelve, “_Prima quarta acta
    est_;” at half-past, “_Sesqui est duodecima_,” at which
    welcome words books are shut, and the whole school is
    dismissed. The same formalities, with the necessary
    variations, are repeated during afternoon lessons. Before
    dinner the Captain calls out two boys of the Second
    Election, one to say grace—“_Age gratias_”—and the other to
    repeat the proper responses—“_Agite responsa_;” and when
    dinner is over, before grace again, he pays even the
    juniors the compliment of asking whether they have had
    enough—“_Satisne edistis et bibistis?_” to which the
    compulsory answer is made—in old times too often by hungry
    lips—“_Satis edimus et bibimus_.” Every night at ten o’clock
    the monitor of chamber gives the order for the juniors to
    put out the lights and go to bed—“_Extinctis lucernis
    intrate lectos_.” It is only within the last generation or
    two that the rule of speaking Latin exclusively, both by
    boys and masters, during school hours has fallen into
    abeyance.


*Westminster Play.*—A Latin comedy, presented annually in the
    dormitory of St. Peter’s College, a custom dating from Queen
    Elizabeth’s days. The performances take place just before
    the Christmas holidays, the play being repeated three times.
    The cast is strictly confined to the forty scholars on the
    foundation. At the close of last presentation a CAP (_q.v._)
    is collected, the surplus of which, after paying expenses,
    is divided among the performers.


*Wet-bob*, _subs._ (Eton).—A rowing man. _See_ DRY-BOB.

  1839. C. T. BUCKLAND, _Eton Fifty Years Ago_ [1889, _Macmillan’s_,
  Nov.]. It was the ambition of most boys to be a WET-BOB, and to be “in
  the boats.” The school was divided between WET-BOBS and dry-bobs, the
  former taking their pleasure on the river, and the latter in the
  cricket-field.


*Whale*, _subs._ 1. (Cheltenham).—Codfish.

    2. (Royal Military Academy).—A sardine.


*Whiter*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A white waistcoat: this may be worn
    by those who have been three years in the school.

    stick or “wicket.”

    Walk; a part of the garden. _Cf._ GERARD, _Stonyhurst_, p.
    179.


*Wilderness* (Charterhouse).—A playing ground at Old
    Charterhouse before Thomas Sutton bought the estate: now a
    belt of trees to the south of UNDER-GREEN (_q.v._).


*Wine*, _subs._ (University).—A wine-party. Also as _verb_.

  1853. BRADLEY, _Verdant Green_, vii. Now I’m going to WINE with Smalls
  to-night.


*Wise Men of the East*, _subs. phr._ (Cambridge).—The last
    twelve in the Mathematical TRIPOS (_q.v._).

  1785. GROSE, _Vulg. Tongue_, s.v. PLUCK.... These unfortunate
  individuals were designated by many opprobrious appellations, such as
  the Twelve Apostles, the Legion of Honour, WISE MEN OF THE EAST, &c.


*Wooston*, _adv._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Very: _e.g._ WOOSTON a
    jolly fellow; a WOOSTON jolly fellow; I am WOOSTON, chaffy.
    [That is, “whore son.”—GUILLEMARD.]


*Work*, _subs._ (Winchester).—Pain. Also as _verb_ = to hurt.

  14[?]. _Townley Mysteries_, “Processus Noe.” My bonys are so stark No
  wonder if they WARK For I am full old.

  14[?]. _Alexander_ [ASHMOL.], line 531. So sare WERKIS hire the wame.
  _Ibid._, line 539. Of *WERKE* well ne I wede (am mad).

  1469. MALORY, _Morte d’Arthur_. But I may not stonde, myn hede WERCHES
  soo.

  1750. COLLIER, _Works_. I gran an I thrutcht, till my arms WARTCHD
  agen.

  1860. R. BRIERLY, _Ab. in London_. I shaked his hond till my arm
  WARTCHT, then he shaked mine till his arm WARTCHT.

  1891. WRENCH, _Winchester Word-Book_, s.v. WORK. The use of REMEDY
  (_q.v._) for a holiday seems to imply that WORK is a painful disease.


*Worms*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A trenched line on the turf: used
    as goal at football. _See_ quot.

  1881. PASCOE, _Life in Our Public Schools_. Across the two ends of the
  ground a small trench is dug, about four inches wide and two deep, and
  a goal is obtained when the ball is fairly kicked across the trench
  (Wiccamicé WORMS).


*Wrangler*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The name given to those who are
    placed in the first class in the first or elementary portion
    of the public examination for honours in pure and mixed
    mathematics, commonly called the Mathematical Tripos, those
    placed in the second class being known as Senior Optimes,
    and those in the third class as Junior Optimes. Up to and
    including the year 1882, the student who took absolutely the
    first place in the Mathematical Tripos used to be termed
    Senior Wrangler; those who came next to him being second,
    third, fourth, &c., wranglers. Since then the title has been
    given to the student who takes the first place in Part I. of
    the Mathematical Tripos. The name is derived from the public
    disputations, in which candidates for degrees were formerly
    required to exhibit their powers.

  1870. _The Blue_, March. We were rejoiced to hear of the University
  success of a late Grecian—G. A. Greenhill, who was announced as Second
  WRANGLER in the late Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge. Further on in
  the month we heard of his being bracketed with Mr. Pendlebury (the
  Senior WRANGLER) as Smith’s Prizeman, a thing seldom heard of at
  Cambridge, and never before has any Blue attained that high honour.

    TO GET YARDS, _verb. phr._ (Harrow).—To get a catch at
    football and be allowed a free kick, not running more than
    can be covered in three running strides. Hence TO GIVE YARDS
    = to give such a catch; TO STEP YARDS = to cover the
    distance in “kicking off yards” in three strides; TO KNOCK
    DOWN YARDS = to prevent another from “taking yards.”
    [Originally three yards.]


*Yards* (The), _subs._ 1. (Durham).—The list of members,
    originally of the First Game, but now of the Second Game—at
    football or cricket. [Formerly in the cricket season only a
    patch of ground thirty yards square was mowed. Those who had
    the privilege of playing on this were said to be “on the
    YARDS.”]

    2. (Royal High School, Edin.).—The gravel-covered
    playground.

    (North) = to strike, to beat.]


*Yellow-hammer*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—A BLUE (_q.v._) in
    disgrace for gross misconduct and under discipline. _See_
    quot.

  1844. _Reminis. of Christ’s Hospital_ [The Blue, August 1874]. In the
  case of a hardened offender, or of gross misdemeanour, a system of
  degradation was adopted, by causing the culprit to wear his coat
  turned inside out, and as the body of the coat had a yellow lining,
  the metamorphosis was remarkably striking, and (unkindest cut of all!)
  the subjects of this hideous transformation—these involuntary
  turn-coats—were by their schoolfellows nicknamed YELLOW-HAMMERS.


*Yolly*, _subs._ (Winchester: obsolete).—A post-chaise. [That
    is, “Yellow,” that having been generally a favourite colour
    for these vehicles.]


*-y*, _inseparable suffix_ (Manchester Grammar).—_See_ MATHY,
    CHEMMY, GYMMY, &c.

*A*, _subs._ (Felsted).—_See_ D, _infra._


*Abbey, The* (Durham).—The Cathedral. The boys of Durham
    School (and they alone) speak, and always have spoken, of
    the Cathedral as “the Abbey.” This is supposed to show
    that the school dates from pre-Reformation days, though
    its foundation is put down to the time of Henry VIII. The
    Charity Commissioners admit the claim, and pay to the
    Head-master a pension founded by Cardinal Langley in 1415
    for the master of his school in Durham.


*Academia*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A select literary club: in
    vogue where the Jesuit _Ratio Studiorum_ flourishes. Not now

    the end of the year.

    _bannet_.

*Beast*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—_See_ BRUTE.

    Head-master. _See_ ante.


*Black Monday* (Stonyhurst).—The day of re-opening of schools.


*Blandyke* (Stonyhurst).—_See_ ante. It may be interesting to
    call attention to the connection between Stonyhurst and St.
    Omers and many of the words and phrases occurring in this
    vocabulary. They not only date from the Continental period,
    but find their explanation in it alone. The College was
    founded in 1592 at St. Omers, and continued without a break
    (at Bruges and Liège) previous to the settlement in England
    in 1794.


*Bloody Wars*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A common name for any
    stiffness: such as that usually experienced at the beginning
    of the football or cricket season: _e.g._ “I’ve got the
    BLOODY WARS.”


*Blue*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ ante; concerning the
    dress, I learn that the cap was given up many years ago.

    Also CROMWELL’S-BRIDGE, though it is probable that Cromwell
    crossed the Hodder higher up. _See_ HIGGER BRIG.


*Cage, The* (Royal High School, Edin.).—A covered area, between
    two gates, in which prisoners at games are confined. Also,
    as _verb_ = to put in this enclosure.


*Candle-keepers*, _subs._ (Winchester).—MANSFIELD in his
    _School-Life at Winchester College_, p. 30 (_see_ quot.
    1840, _ante_), says, “Why so called I have no idea,” but
    _see_ ADAM’S _Wykehamica_ (1878), 418.

    by the recipient. _See_ ante.


*Cork*, _verb_ (Eton).—To throw. [An Old Etonian informs me that
    “Cork” and not CALK (_q.v._) is the correct orthography.]


*Cowshed, The* (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ ante. It should be
    stated that THE COWSHED is a sort of pent-house near the
    Warden’s residence which workmen use for divers purposes.

    Nominally the bounds were:—A = practically no bounds; B =
    the ordinary bounds, the roads about a mile from the school;
    C = punishment bounds, confinement to the cricket-fields and
    playground; and D = confinement to the old school-house
    playground, one of the commonest forms of punishment till
    1876, when the present school-house was opened. C and D were
    also known respectively as MONGREL and QUOD.


*Dame*, _subs._ (Eton and Harrow).—Originally many ladies kept
    boarding-houses: hence the word. _See_ ante.


*Damnation-hill* (Harrow).—_See_ DAMNATION-CORNER and HOWSON and
    WARNER, _Harrow School_ (1898), 80.


*Degerd*, _adj._ (Harrow).—Degraded. [Pronounced _Daygerd_.]


*Dicks’* (Stonyhurst).—The chief tuck-shop at the present time.


*Ditch, The* (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ ante. THE DITCH is one
    of the three playgrounds, or rather open spaces, within the
    walls of Christ’s Hospital: it takes its name from the old
    City ditch which ran beneath it. The two others are the
    “Hall Play,” and the “Garden.”

    a stake for the fire.

  1827. COLLINS, _The Public Schools_ [Harrow], p. 318. Poker and tongs
  were unknown luxuries in the “play-room” at Butler’s; and the junior
  fag, at the call of “FAG poker,” had to rush out in the cold to pull a
  hedge-stake of substantial dimensions from the fence or faggot-stack.


*Feeder-cric* (Christ’s Hospital).—_See_ ante. This game got its
    name from the “feeder,” _i.e._ the thrower of the ball, and
    the humble imitation that it was of cricket. The bat was a
    stick like a “glorified” ruler, but cut away at one end to
    resemble in some sort a cricket-bat. It was played against a
    buttress, on which was marked a circle in chalk, which
    served as a wicket. The ball was soft, with a hole in it; as
    in rounders the batsman might insist on certain conditions
    as to the method of “feeding,” and might refuse to recognise
    a “feed” unreasonable in height.


    *First-praise*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—_See_ REPORT.


    *First-touch.* TO BE FIRST-TOUCH, _verb. phr._

        2. (Stonyhurst).—A boy who does not play in
        any of the regular (cricket) matches. For

        the FLAB’S-NET.


    *Fob*, _verb_ (Christ’s Hospital).—To put on
        carelessly: as bands or buttons, without
        trouble, to look right for a minute or so.

        STONYHURST-FOOTBALL.

    *Form-game*, _subs._ (Harrow: obsolete).—At

        ability, and not by Houses. They were named
        on the same principle as the school is
        arranged—Sixth Form game, Fifth Form game,
        and so on.


    *Forty*, _subs._ (Felsted).—A division of the school
        for football or cricket. Each FORTY has its own

        given to a diminutive Association ball: formerly
        one of hair and chamois-leather.


    *Fungi*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital)—India-rubber.




    *Gomer*, _subs._ (Winchester).—_See_ ante, sense 2.
        I am informed that there is yet another usage.
        GOMERS = a suit of clothes in which to go home.
        [Because College men wear gowns.]


    *Goose-match*, _subs._ (Harrow).—_See_ ante, and
        quot.

      1898. S. W. GORE, _Harrow School_, 225. Harrow is, I
      believe, one of the few schools where cricket is played in
      the Michaelmas term, when the traditional “GOOSE” MATCH is
      played. This was started on the 22nd of September 1849 by
      Mr. C. O. Eaton.


    *Grammar-match*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A football
        match in which the members of the highest class

    *Grasshopper*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital:
        Hertford).—A BLUE-girl: used by boys at
        Hertford. _See_ BLUEBOTTLE (Appendix) and
        HEDGEHOG (_ante_).


    *Great Figures* (Stonyhurst).—_See_ FIGURES, _ante_.


    *Grecian*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital).—Add
        following to 1871 quot.:—

      Then on leaving the school for college they obtain a gift
      of £60 for clothing and outfit, and an allowance of £70 a
      year while at college. Nor do they seem to owe any further
      allegiance in after life to Christ’s Hospital. For
      instance, many lads are educated specially for the navy,
      and are distinguished from the others by wearing a metal
      badge on the shoulder, but on leaving Christ’s they do not
      necessarily enter maritime life.




    *Head.* HEAD OF THE LINE, _subs. phr._
        (Stonyhurst).—The Captain of the School.

        going into the centre and calling “King!” The
        centre player endeavours to catch some one, who
        then joins him, and this goes on till all are
        caught. A rush is then made for the side, the
        last to reach it taking the centre place in a
        new game. It forms an excellent training for

      The most distinctive feature in the MATHEMAT life was the
      yearly “going to Court.” Our hair was trimmed and brushed
      for the occasion by the Hospital barber, buttonholes and
      gloves lavished on us. When we went to Buckingham Palace
      we drove five in a carriage, the redundant gentleman being
      literally and metaphorically sat upon by his justly
      indignant comrades. But more interesting were our visits
      to Windsor, with the march from the station to the Castle,
      the long weary waiting in endless corridors and gorgeous
      ante-chambers, the well-earned lunch, with John Brown
      peeping in at the door; then Her Majesty’s inspection of
      our drawings; and finally, our free range over the Castle
      and toilsome ascent of the Round Tower. I remember the
      following circumstance: One MATHEMAT exhibited a painting
      of a ship still building. Prince George of Wales remarked
      to his brother, “What a ‘rummy’ ship,” at which the

            a Spital Sermon preached in Christ
            Church, Newgate Street, April 23rd,
            1644: it is quaint. In recent years
            the Lord Mayor’s chaplain preached
            on Easter Monday, a bishop on
            Tuesday, but within the last twenty
            years the Monday sermon has been
            given up. Also, the boys no longer
            wear the bit of paper bearing the

        *Spot.* ON THE SPOT, _phr._

            (2) in good condition.


        *Stonyhurst-cricket*, _subs._
            (Stonyhurst: recently obsolete).—A
            form of cricket played till very
            recent times at Stonyhurst, the
            ordinary game being known as
            LONDON-CRICKET. The points of
            difference are chiefly these: (1)
            the balls must be swift, and bowled
            along the ground; (2) the batsman
            must hit—“slog” is the term; and (3)
            the game is played at a single
            wicket. Bat, ball, and wickets
            differ in shape and size from those
            used in cricket proper. In Father
            Gerard’s _Stonyhurst_ will be found
            a detailed account of the game, and
            a connection is traced between it
            and a crude form once played at
            Eton. It is in all probability a
            survival of very primitive cricket
            which became stereotyped because of
            the life of the College abroad.


        *Stonyhurst-football*, _subs._
            (Stonyhurst).—A kind of football
            played at Stonyhurst and some other
            schools. It differs materially from
            the Association and Rugby game,
            chiefly in these respects: (1) any
            number may play at once; (2) the
            ball may be touched by the hand
            during the game, but not handled or
            carried as in Rugby football; (3)
            charging, or otherwise roughly
            treating another player, is
            prohibited. The goal-posts are
            longer and the space between them
            narrower than in other forms of the
            game; the ball is small and round.
            It is akin to a species of football
            played at Eton, and is clearly a
            relic of the past. In matches the
            sides usually have names: _e.g._
            “French and English,” in the Grand
            Matches—a significant survival from
            old continental days; “Federals and
            Allies” (now obsolete); “Pipes and
            Windows”—a favourite impromptu
            match, the “Pipes” being those who
            sit on one side of the old “Study
            Place,” the “Windows” those who sit
            on the other. Now that the “Pipes”
            (hot-water pipes) are on the same
            side as the windows, the match is
            more commonly called “Walls and
            Windows,” but sometimes “Chapel
            Pipes and Windows.” “Shavers and
            Non-shavers” is another favourite
            match.


        *Strue*, _subs._ (general).—A construe.
            _See_ CON.


        *Superd.* TO BE SUPERD, _verb. phr._
            (Harrow).—To be superannuated.


        *Swack*, _subs._ (Christ’s
            Hospital).—Deception. Whence TO
            SWACK UP = to deceive; to take in.


        *Swagger* (or *Side*), _subs._
            (Harrow).—(1) Appropriating
            privileges to which one has no
            right; and (2) using peculiar
            privileges which others may not use.
            Etiquette in this respect is very
            complex.

          1898. WARNER, _Harrow School_, 280. The rules
          of “SWAGGER” are most complex, like other
          traditional and unwritten codes, and in them a
          new boy is apt to find himself entangled. He
          goes out with his umbrella rolled up, and he
          finds he is swaggering; or he carries it by
          its middle, or under his arm, or he walks on
          the middle terrace after chapel, or he
          innocently wears his “blues” open when it is
          hot, or turns his trousers up when it is wet,
          and again he is swaggering. Lady visitors
          sometimes think small boys at Harrow rude. It
          is not rudeness which leads boys to stick
          close to the wall, even when coming up covered
          with mud from football, and shoulder the world
          into the gutter, it is modesty; to walk in the
          road is SWAGGER. To loiter at the house door,
          or to sing or whistle in the passages, and to
          wear a hat in the house are also forms of
          SWAGGER.




        *Taff*, _subs._ (Christ’s Hospital:
            Hertford).—A potato.


        *Talker*, _subs._ (Harrow).—One who
            cannot sing in time.

          1898. HOWSON and WARNER, _Harrow School_, 208.
          Then followed solos from those who could sing
          and those who could not—it made no difference.
          The latter class were called TALKERS, and
          every boy was encouraged to stand up and “talk
          it out.”


        *Tap*, _subs._ (Eton).—Originally the
            CHRISTOPHER (_q.v._). Now the only
            place recognised by the authorities
            where a boy can get beer.


        *Tart-feast*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst:
            obsolete).—Certain feasts indulged
            in by classes at the end of the
            school year.


        *Temple of Bel[l], The* (Royal High
            School, Edin.: obsolete).—A square
            tower at the north-east corner of
            the playground in which the bell was
            formerly hung: now rendered
            invisible by the new buildings.


        *Tetra* (Felsted).—_See_ ante. Also as
            _adj._: _e.g._ a science boy
            regarded “Stinks” as “TETRA-buck.”


        *Thirders*, _subs._ (Harrow).—The Third
            Eleven.


        *Three Hundred Day* (Stonyhurst).—_See_
            DAY.


        *Three-yearer*, _subs._ (Harrow).—A boy
            who has been three years in the
            school, and who, by seniority, has
            the right to do certain things,
            which his juniors may not do.


        *Ticket*, _subs._ (Winchester).—A
            promise, given by a Prefect to a
            Junior, to remit the next punishment
            when incurred.


        *Titch*, _subs._ (Christ’s
            Hospital).—_See_ ante. It is
            suggested that TITCH is a
            “portmanteau word”—“tight breeches,”
            the tightening of the garment being
            often a preliminary to the
            operation.


        *Tizzy-tick*, _subs._ (Harrow).—An order
            on a tradesman to the extent of
            sixpence a day.


        *Tolly, The* (Rugby).—_See_ quot.

          1900. _Athenæum_, 16th June, p. 743. The
          chapel rather loses by its stunted head,
          especially as a fine tapering spire
          (disrespectfully known as “THE TOLLY”) appears
          at the back of the Close.


        *Tolly-shop*, _subs._
            (Stonyhurst).—_See_ PREFECT’S-ROOM.


        *Tolly-ticket*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A
            custom now generally obsolete, but
            still kept up by some masters. It
            used to be common, and consisted in
            giving a boy a card of good conduct
            as a reward for specially good work.
            If, later, he were to incur
            punishment for some offence, he
            would produce this card, and, unless
            the offence were too grave, could
            thereby receive a free pardon. Such
            cards were called TOLLY TICKETS or
            IMMUNITY CARDS. [A precisely similar
            custom is described as having
            existed at Eton in the forties by
            Mr. C. Kegan Paul in his
            _Memories_.]


        *Tonk*, _verb_ (Durham).—To hit: a
            cricket term.


        *Trav*, _subs._
            (Felsted).—Travelling-money. _See_
            HOTS.


        *Tubby* (Christ’s Hospital).—A male
            servant of the school: his business
            was to move certain tubs, the use of
            which has long been discontinued,
            but the name remains.


        *Tuft*, _subs._ (University).—A young
            nobleman, entered as a student at a
            university, so called from the TUFT
            or gold tassel worn on the cap. Also
            GOLD-HATBAND (_q.v._). Whence
            “tuft-hunter.”


        *Tuz I*, _phr._ (Felsted).—The same as
            FAIN IT (_q.v._), BAGS I (_q.v._),
            &c.


        *Twelve* (Harrow).—_See_ ante.

            THE SCHOOL TWELVE, _subs. phr._
            (Harrow).—The twelve best singers
            (bass and tenor voices singing in
            unison) in the school. Whence THE
            HOUSE TWELVE = the same in each
            House.


        *Twug* (Harrow).—Caught. [The _past
            par._ of “twig.”]




        *Vacation-shoes* (or *-clothes*),
            _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—Each boy is
            measured for these before the summer
            holidays.


        *Victory-walk*, _subs._ (Stonyhurst).—A
            recognised reward given every
            half-term to the classes of the
            LOWER LINE (_q.v._). The system is
            as follows:—Each class is divided
            into two sides, ROMANS and
            CARTHAGINIANS, the boys being set
            one against another as rivals. When
            lessons are asked, the rivals are
            asked in pairs, and each tries to
            correct the other. A successful
            correction is called a VICTORY. At
            the end of the half-term these
            victories are counted: the side
            which has the greater total is freed
            some afternoon for a VICTORY-WALK.


        *Vile-child*, _subs._ (Eton).—I am
            informed that this expression was
            only used by a particular tutor, and
            was never regarded as _peculiar_ to
            Eton phraseology.


        *Vill*, _subs._ (Felsted).—The village
            of Felsted.


        *Vish*, _adj._ (Christ’s
            Hospital).—Cross: the modern
            equivalent of PASSY (_q.v._). [That
            is, “vicious.”]




        *Whopping*, _subs._ (Harrow).—1. A
            beating with a cane inflicted by a
            Monitor, Head of House, Sixth Form
            boy, &c., on a lower boy for a
            breach of discipline.

            2. A MONITOR’S-WHOPPING—a more
            serious affair, only inflicted in
            grave cases; the delinquent is
            brought before the whole body of the
            Monitors in the Vaughan Library, and
            punishment given there.


        *Wooden-spoon*, _subs._ (Cambridge).—The
            student last on the list of
            mathematical honours. _See_ TRIPOS,
            GULF, TWELVE APOSTLES, WRANGLER, &c.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
